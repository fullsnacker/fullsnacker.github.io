<p>Finding inspiration for any design is key. Whether it&#8217;s nature, the way a building looks or from other websites. These are the 3 main websites that I use on a consistent basis when I need inspiration for a website I&#8217;m designing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll say this right off the bat, I do not believe is ripping someone&#8217;s&nbsp;work off. Changing a few photos and <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="5" data-gr-id="5">a font</g> isn&#8217;t enough. Finding pieces of different sites that you like and putting them together is the way to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dribbble</h2>
