<p>Being in the field of development for several years, one of the most common questions I get asked is, &#8220;What&#8217;s your best advice for someone learning to program?&#8221;. So I&#8217;ve put together my top 5 pieces of advice that I found most helpful in my career in programming. Hopefully you find them helpful as well and if you have any other advice to add, please leave a comment!</p>



<h2>What do you want to program?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-1024x574.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12320" srcset="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-1024x574.png 1024w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-300x168.png 300w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-768x431.png 768w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This first one here might not sound like advice but it really is. Many people come into the field wanting to start programming but don&#8217;t realize the amount languages and directions you can take with code. I&#8217;ll tell you right now you cannot do them all, so picking a direction is crucial.</p>



<p>For me, I started my career as a graphic designer which quickly transition into web development. I had done some preliminary app development before that but found myself thoroughly enjoying web development more and more. So HTML, CSS, and Javascript were the languages to learn. After getting well versed in those I moved on to SASS, PHP and MySQL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had chosen app development my choice of programming languages would have <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">be</g>en very different. I&#8217;m not going to go into all the languages related to each field but it is important to ask yourself that question and find the answer.</p>

<h2>Just start</h2>



<p>This is probably my favorite piece of advice on coding and life in general. Just start. Honestly, if you want to do something you have to start. I understand something you can&#8217;t just do right away, but start doing something to get you there. Take steps in the direction you want to go. Don&#8217;t tell me you really want to be a programmer. Start coding. There are piles of resources from learning and expanding your knowledge.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The best way to learn something is to get your hands dirty with it.</p><cite><br></cite></blockquote>



<p>If you want to start programming or want to learn a new framework or different language, just start. Download a text editor and start writing some code.</p>



<h2>From the ground up</h2>



<p>Someone asked me if they should start learning a library first rather than the base language because the library was easier. And as I always say, start from the ground up.</p>



<p>When I was first learning to program, I didn&#8217;t want to use <strong>ANY</strong> libraries or frameworks. I wanted to write every piece of code myself so I knew exactly what everything was doing. Looking back I realize that was a little zealous and unrealistic but I believe the underlying drive was good.</p>



<p>Knowing the basics and being able to code in the vanilla language is crucial in my opinion to becoming a better programmer.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Trying to learn frameworks and libraries without starting with the base languages is like trying to build a house without a foundation.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Try things</h2>



<p>One of the best ways to learn how to code or learn a new framework or library is through tutorials.&nbsp;The amount of free education in the field of programming is astounding and if you want to know my top recommendations for where to learn you can check out my article on the subject&nbsp;<a href="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/13/the-best-3-resources-to-learn-how-to-code/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Tutorials are amazing but just going through a tutorial is not enough. You need to mess around with it, try different things, make it do something else. This is the probably my number one tip for learning how to code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can honestly say I learn so much more when I do variations of a tutorial than just leaving it at what was shown. I often find several related tutorials and then try and combine them to create what I want to create. Now, this stems back to my first point of knowing what you want to program.</p>



<p>For example, when I started learning the React framework I went through a tutorial that showed me the basics as well as a tutorial that showed me how to make API calls. I combined the two tutorials to create a simple web app that pulled my profile and feed data from Instagram. I learned so much more from trying to get that app to work than just going through the tutorial. Learning like this helps you to really understand what is going on rather than just following along.</p>

<p></p>



<h2>Start Simple</h2>



<p>In my example above, I started learning the React framework by building a super simple app that just pulled information from Instagram&#8217;s API. Understanding the basics is huge as I mentioned in my point about starting from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biting off more than you can chew is something that I have and often am guilty of. It&#8217;s important when learning code not to get overwhelmed because, no matter what language you start with, it&#8217;s a lot of information to take in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making small wins is crucial in a developer&#8217;s career because it&#8217;s those moments that will push you on through the next challenge. Getting &#8220;Hello World&#8221; to show up on a screen in rewarding!</p>



<h2>You got to love it</h2>



<p>This is an extra point but it&#8217;s one I love throwing in at the end. You have got to love it. Coding is hours and days and months and years of learning. It takes a tremendous amount of time to become fluent in coding and even longer to become an expert. All that to say that it is an incredibly&nbsp;rewarding field that allows you to create amazing, beautiful and useful things that you can share with the world.</p>
