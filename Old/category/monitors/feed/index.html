<p>Everybody loves more screen space, especially programmers. And in today’s work environment most development teams and coders work off laptops (usually Macs). So the real struggle is finding more of it. As soon as I sit down, I immediately look for an external monitor to plug into. If possible to connect to two monitors, then I am really in luck. But the white whale of laptop setups is connecting three monitors to one laptop. Today, I’m going to share how I did it!</p>



<h2>Computer</h2>



<p>First things first, your computer has got to be able to handle the number of pixels it&#8217;s going to be pushing. I’m letting you know right off the hop, a 13” MacBook Pro cannot handle three displays regardless of the resolution. Two is the max, but you can keep the laptop open so it like 2.5 monitors.</p>



<p>I got my triple monitor setup working with my 15”, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB memory, Radeon Pro 450 2 GB Intel HD Graphics 530 1536 MB, MacBook Pro. If you would like to know everything I use in my setup, check out my article on it at <a href="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/">https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/</a>. <br></p>

<h2>Dongle</h2>



<p>One of the most important things about making the triple monitor setup work is the dongle. Now I’m going to save my rant on the dongle life for another time but you need to choose the right dongle. I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KafG3b">iHaper USB-C hub</a> because it’s the one I use and its worked great. If you go with another dongle/hub, make sure that it has at least one HDMI port (for monitor), one USB-C port (for power), and one standard USB port (for keyboard). </p>



<h2>Cables</h2>



<p>This is one that I think a lot of people don’t think of when they’re getting their setup wired. Since the MacBook Pro’s only have USB-C inputs you either have to use a converter to connect your HDMI monitor or, and this is the one I use, you buy <a href="https://amzn.to/2XlNReJ">HDMI to USB-C cables</a>. You will also need just a regular HDMI cable as well that will plug into the dongle.</p>

<h2>Monitors</h2>



<p>Three monitors is the max that a 15” MacBook Pro can handle but only one can be 4k. The others need to be 1080p. You can, however, have the laptop open as another display. 13” MacBooks can only handle two external displays and they cannot be 4k. If you’re more interested in quality then, you can connect two 4k monitors to your 15” MacBook.</p>



<h2>Laptop Stand</h2>



<p>This is not necessary but if you’re like me and like to keep the desk clutter to a minimum, it&#8217;s a huge help. I use the<a href="https://amzn.to/2WImCX2"> Arc upright laptop stand</a>. It keeps the cable chaos under control as well as looking pretty cool.</p>

<h2>Connecting</h2>



<ol><li>The laptop must be on or sleeping (must not be shutdown)</li><li>Plug the regular HDMI cable into dongle and monitor</li><li>Plug power cable into dongle and power source (When multiple displays are plugged in, the laptop must be plugged in to operate)</li><li>Plug keyboard into the dongle (optional if you plan on using the laptop as a display)</li><li>Connect HDMI-to-USB-C cables to monitors.</li><li>Plug the dongle into one side of the laptop</li><li>Connect the other two HDMI-to-USB-C cables to the laptop</li><li>Click mouse or type on the keyboard to wake up the laptop</li><li>Monitors should now all be displaying</li></ol>



<h2>Settings</h2>



<p>To change the arrangement of the screens, go to System Preferences &gt; Displays &gt; Arrangement. You can now click and drag around how you would like your setup. A red border will signify the display that you are moving. You can also change the resolutions and other settings here to customize your setup.</p>
