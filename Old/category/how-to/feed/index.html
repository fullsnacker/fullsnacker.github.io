<p>You want to learn to program but don&#8217;t know where to start. You want to level up your skills but you don&#8217;t have a mentor. You want to learn how to make an application with authentication. The list can go on and on and they all have the same answer; tutorials.</p>



<p>There are piles of free and paid tutorials out there which makes it hard to find the really good ones. I have gone through countless tutorials on multiple different sites but the one I keep going back to is Udemy.</p>



<p>Udemy has taught me so much and I attribute a huge amount of my success to all the awesome courses that they offer. You&#8217;ll notice that I prefer certain instructors and you can find them at the end of this article. I would recommend any of the courses they offer.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/javascript-advanced/" target="_blank">Advanced JavaScript</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12311" width="244" height="137" srcset="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg 480w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></figure>



<p>There are a lot of free hello world tutorials out there for learning Javascript but after learning the basics I was looking for a way to level up. This course takes you through and explains the basics as well as advanced concepts in JavaScript. Understanding even the basics in a detailed way helped me understand how the language works on a deeper level. If you&#8217;re looking to level up your JS skills this course if for you.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Node with React (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/" target="_blank">Node with React</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1254420_f6cb_4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2742"/></figure>



<p>You guys know how much I love React. Well, this course was the beginning for me. I learned from start to finish, project structure, life cycle methods, processing payments, setting up a node server and all the rest. This is an incredibly thorough course that breaks down even the most complex concepts into understandable bites. If you want to learn React this is the one I would recommend the most. As a note, he uses a Mongo DB for the database which I recommend as well and I have a course for it further down.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="React Redux Firebase (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-firebase/" target="_blank">React Redux Firebase</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1532232_1cdc_8.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2743"/></figure>



<p>Working with Mongo is awesome but it does require a backend server so when I found out about Firebase and that its serverless I hoped on. And obviously, I&#8217;m going to use React as the frontend but state management can be a lot but Redux is so good for it. This course shows how to make them all work together and the flow has been one that I&#8217;ve used in multiple projects. If you&#8217;re looking to work with these frameworks, I would highly recommend this course.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/" target="_blank">Mongo DB</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1000574_06cb.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2745"/></figure>



<p>One of the first web development jobs was working on an application that used Mongo DB it holds a special place in my heart. And I have used other databases but I always come back to Mongo. This course shows you how to manage and utilize all the amazing capabilities that Mongo DB offers. He does a great job of explaining what he&#8217;s doing as he&#8217;s doing it and is really easy to follow. If you&#8217;re going to start using Mongo DB, this course is what you need.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Angular 8 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/" target="_blank">Angular 8</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/756150_c033_2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2746"/></figure>



<p>Now you guys know I&#8217;m all about React but recently I had to learn Angular 8 for a project. Although I was reluctant, tools and tools and I&#8217;ve learned not to smack talk other frameworks and actually gained an appreciation for Angular. This was the course that I crashed through to ramp on the project and it was a great experience. This course takes you from start to finish on how to use the framework as well as all the tools that the CLI offers to make development that much faster. So If you want to get started in Angular this course if a home run.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bonus Ionic 4 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/ionic-2-the-practical-guide-to-building-ios-android-apps/" target="_blank">Bonus Ionic 4</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1070124_3a0f_3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2747"/></figure>



<p>For the project that I was referring to in the above article, we were also using ionic to develop. So Ionic 4 was on the roster for the ramp up and obviously, I went straight to Udemy. This course was an awesome find. After going through it myself I sent it to my coworkers and they also found it super helpful. He shows you all the capabilities of the framework and how to get your project showing up on your phone in no time. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Ionic, it&#8217;s a framework that turns your web development project into a native app. It originally was only for Angular but recently just released support for React and Vue. So if you want to turn to web development skills into native app development this course is a great option.</p>

<h2>Recommended Instructors</h2>



<p>My two favorite instructors on Udemy are Stephen Grider and Maximilian Schwarzmüller. Both do an incredible job of explaining complex concepts in an understandable way, create interesting and useful projects that incorporate all the lessons taught and are easy to follow. If I haven&#8217;t recommended a course that is in your field of interest, I would recommend any of the courses they offer. Both have a vast collection of videos in a plethora of different programming languages.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope you find these suggestions helpful and if I&#8217;ve missed a great course please leave a comment with a link. I would love to hear your guy&#8217;s suggestions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everybody loves more screen space, especially programmers. And in today’s work environment most development teams and coders work off laptops (usually Macs). So the real struggle is finding more of it. As soon as I sit down, I immediately look for an external monitor to plug into. If possible to connect to two monitors, then I am really in luck. But the white whale of laptop setups is connecting three monitors to one laptop. Today, I’m going to share how I did it!</p>



<h2>Computer</h2>



<p>First things first, your computer has got to be able to handle the number of pixels it&#8217;s going to be pushing. I’m letting you know right off the hop, a 13” MacBook Pro cannot handle three displays regardless of the resolution. Two is the max, but you can keep the laptop open so it like 2.5 monitors.</p>



<p>I got my triple monitor setup working with my 15”, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB memory, Radeon Pro 450 2 GB Intel HD Graphics 530 1536 MB, MacBook Pro. If you would like to know everything I use in my setup, check out my article on it at <a href="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/">https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/</a>. <br></p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>



<h2>Dongle</h2>



<p>One of the most important things about making the triple monitor setup work is the dongle. Now I’m going to save my rant on the dongle life for another time but you need to choose the right dongle. I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KafG3b">iHaper USB-C hub</a> because it’s the one I use and its worked great. If you go with another dongle/hub, make sure that it has at least one HDMI port (for monitor), one USB-C port (for power), and one standard USB port (for keyboard). </p>



<h2>Cables</h2>



<p>This is one that I think a lot of people don’t think of when they’re getting their setup wired. Since the MacBook Pro’s only have USB-C inputs you either have to use a converter to connect your HDMI monitor or, and this is the one I use, you buy <a href="https://amzn.to/2XlNReJ">HDMI to USB-C cables</a>. You will also need just a regular HDMI cable as well that will plug into the dongle.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>



<h2>Monitors</h2>



<p>Three monitors is the max that a 15” MacBook Pro can handle but only one can be 4k. The others need to be 1080p. You can, however, have the laptop open as another display. 13” MacBooks can only handle two external displays and they cannot be 4k. If you’re more interested in quality then, you can connect two 4k monitors to your 15” MacBook.</p>



<h2>Laptop Stand</h2>



<p>This is not necessary but if you’re like me and like to keep the desk clutter to a minimum, it&#8217;s a huge help. I use the<a href="https://amzn.to/2WImCX2"> Arc upright laptop stand</a>. It keeps the cable chaos under control as well as looking pretty cool.</p>



<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6616654362"></ins>



<h2>Connecting</h2>



<ol><li>The laptop must be on or sleeping (must not be shutdown)</li><li>Plug the regular HDMI cable into dongle and monitor</li><li>Plug power cable into dongle and power source (When multiple displays are plugged in, the laptop must be plugged in to operate)</li><li>Plug keyboard into the dongle (optional if you plan on using the laptop as a display)</li><li>Connect HDMI-to-USB-C cables to monitors.</li><li>Plug the dongle into one side of the laptop</li><li>Connect the other two HDMI-to-USB-C cables to the laptop</li><li>Click mouse or type on the keyboard to wake up the laptop</li><li>Monitors should now all be displaying</li></ol>



<h2>Settings</h2>



<p>To change the arrangement of the screens, go to System Preferences &gt; Displays &gt; Arrangement. You can now click and drag around how you would like your setup. A red border will signify the display that you are moving. You can also change the resolutions and other settings here to customize your setup.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this has been helpful and if you are having any trouble getting it working, leave a comment below and I’ll do my best to help you out. Happy coding, designing, gaming or whatever you’re doing with your computer!</p>

<p>Being in the field of development for several years, one of the most common questions I get asked is, &#8220;What&#8217;s your best advice for someone learning to program?&#8221;. So I&#8217;ve put together my top 5 pieces of advice that I found most helpful in my career in programming. Hopefully you find them helpful as well and if you have any other advice to add, please leave a comment!</p>



<h2>What do you want to program?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-1024x574.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12320" srcset="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-1024x574.png 1024w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-300x168.png 300w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-768x431.png 768w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This first one here might not sound like advice but it really is. Many people come into the field wanting to start programming but don&#8217;t realize the amount languages and directions you can take with code. I&#8217;ll tell you right now you cannot do them all, so picking a direction is crucial.</p>



<p>For me, I started my career as a graphic designer which quickly transition into web development. I had done some preliminary app development before that but found myself thoroughly enjoying web development more and more. So HTML, CSS, and Javascript were the languages to learn. After getting well versed in those I moved on to SASS, PHP and MySQL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had chosen app development my choice of programming languages would have <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">be</g>en very different. I&#8217;m not going to go into all the languages related to each field but it is important to ask yourself that question and find the answer.</p>

<p></p>



<h2>Just start</h2>



<p>This is probably my favorite piece of advice on coding and life in general. Just start. Honestly, if you want to do something you have to start. I understand something you can&#8217;t just do right away, but start doing something to get you there. Take steps in the direction you want to go. Don&#8217;t tell me you really want to be a programmer. Start coding. There are piles of resources from learning and expanding your knowledge. I have an article on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is probably my favourite piece of advice in coding and life in general. Just start.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The best way to learn something is to get your hands dirty with it.</p><cite><br></cite></blockquote>



<p>If you want to start programming or want to learn a new framework or different language, just start. Download a text editor and start writing some code.</p>



<h2>From the ground up</h2>



<p>Someone asked me if they should start learning a library first rather than the base language because the library was easier. And as I always say, start from the ground up.</p>



<p>When I was first learning to program, I didn&#8217;t want to use <strong>ANY</strong> libraries or frameworks. I wanted to write every piece of code myself so I knew exactly what everything was doing. Looking back I realize that was a little zealous and unrealistic but I believe the underlying drive was good.</p>



<p>Knowing the basics and being able to code in the vanilla language is crucial in my opinion to becoming a better programmer.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Trying to learn frameworks and libraries without starting with the base languages is like trying to build a house without a foundation.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Try things</h2>



<p>One of the best ways to learn how to code or learn a new framework or library is through tutorials.&nbsp;The amount of free education in the field of programming is astounding and if you want to know my top recommendations for where to learn you can check out my article on the subject&nbsp;<a href="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/13/the-best-3-resources-to-learn-how-to-code/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Tutorials are amazing but just going through a tutorial is not enough. You need to mess around with it, try different things, make it do something else. This is the probably my number one tip for learning how to code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can honestly say I learn so much more when I do variations of a tutorial than just leaving it at what was shown. I often find several related tutorials and then try and combine them to create what I want to create. Now, this stems back to my first point of knowing what you want to program.</p>



<p>For example, when I started learning the React framework I went through a tutorial that showed me the basics as well as a tutorial that showed me how to make API calls. I combined the two tutorials to create a simple web app that pulled my profile and feed data from Instagram. I learned so much more from trying to get that app to work than just going through the tutorial. Learning like this helps you to really understand what is going on rather than just following along.</p>



<figure><iframe src="//rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?o=15&amp;p=13&amp;l=ur1&amp;category=gift_certificates&amp;banner=0KWQVXX8ESSVZYF450G2&amp;f=ifr&amp;linkID=04ab7ee1d4a078a5cdd9389de683764f&amp;t=fullsnackde02-20&amp;tracking_id=fullsnackde02-20" width="468" height="60"></iframe></figure>



<p></p>



<h2>Start Simple</h2>



<p>In my example above, I started learning the React framework by building a super simple app that just pulled information from Instagram&#8217;s API. Understanding the basics is huge as I mentioned in my point about starting from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biting off more than you can chew is something that I have and often am guilty of. It&#8217;s important when learning code not to get overwhelmed because, no matter what language you start with, it&#8217;s a lot of information to take in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making small wins is crucial in a developer&#8217;s career because it&#8217;s those moments that will push you on through the next challenge. Getting &#8220;Hello World&#8221; to show up on a screen in rewarding!</p>



<h2>You got to love it</h2>



<p>This is an extra point but it&#8217;s one I love throwing in at the end. You have got to love it. Coding is hours and days and months and years of learning. It takes a tremendous amount of time to become fluent in coding and even longer to become an expert. All that to say that it is an incredibly&nbsp;rewarding field that allows you to create amazing, beautiful and useful things that you can share with the world.</p>

<p>I love to longboard, record music, paint, craft, workout, code, design while running two businesses and still have a social life, so time management is something I had to figure out. These are my three tips for managing your time better.</p>



<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>



<h2>Focus</h2>



<p>Now I know this may seem a super general but give me a second to explain. There is a misconception that multitasking is the most effective way to get things done but that&#8217;s not the case. Your brain can only think about one thing at a time, the variable (how good at multitasking you are) is how fast your brain can flip between subjects. And it&#8217;s in these times of flipping back and forth when <g class="gr_ gr_117 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="117" data-gr-id="117">valuable</g> time is lost.</p>



<p>I had a great interview with Mitch from <a href="https://codingwithmitch.com/">CodingWithMitch</a>&nbsp;and the subject of time management came up. He had a great analogy about focus. He said</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Imagine you&#8217;re stacking Jenga blocks. You keep stacking them up higher and higher. Then someone comes along and smacks the whole tower down. And you start stacking the blocks back up again.</p></blockquote>



<p>The blocks are your thought process. When you are undisturbed and focusing on one subject (in this case code) you can stack your thought blocks very high. But when someone interrupts and you have to flip between subjects, you are forced to start stacking all over again.</p>



<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s not realistic to think that you could never go undisturbed once you start working but setting blocks of time to be intentionally focused on one project or problem can be hugely beneficial for your productivity.</p>



<h2>Removing Time Wasters</h2>



<p>All my life I&#8217;ve been told that I have too much time on my hands. This always irked me a little because we all the the same amount of time on our hands. We all have 24 hours in a day.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We all have the same amount of time on our hands. Do things that don&#8217;t waste it.</p></blockquote>



<p>But it got me to thinking about why people feel this way. What I found was that people (including myself) have things in there life that eat away at their time when they don&#8217;t notice, making them feel as though others have more time than they do.</p>



<p>The key is to remove these time wasters. For me it was watching endless Facebook videos. I found myself wasters hours just watching meaningless videos and feeling unsatisfied afterwards. I removed the Facebook app from my phone and found hours of my life back!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m not saying you have to cut Netflix and social apps from your life but being more mindful of things that are prone to waste your time can help you make your time more <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="3" data-gr-id="3">effective</g>. And this perfectly flows into my next and last tip.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Change Your Mentality</h2>



<p>Time management isn&#8217;t about finding more time to work it&#8217;s about finding a proper balance between working and resting. What I was finding was that time wasters were not helping me rest or work but merely distracting me from things that I really wanted to be doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how do determine if something is helping you rest or just waste your <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">time.</g>&nbsp;And this is where you need to change your mentality. The question to ask yourself is&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Does this add value to my life?</p></blockquote>



<p>I doesn&#8217;t have to be work but does this help me relax, or am I investing in a relationship or myself. The answer to that question will help you determine if that&#8217;s something you need/want or whether it&#8217;s just a distraction. Sometimes an episode of New Girl is a great way to unwind from a crazy day. </p>



<p>The key is to evaluate the ways you spend your time and in doing so you will see the areas where you are productive and the ways you waste your time. Change your mentality in this way and you&#8217;ll see that you&#8217;ll become more productive with your time in work and in relaxation.</p>

<iframe src="//rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?o=15&amp;p=48&amp;l=ur1&amp;category=electronics&amp;banner=15REZK87RT5BF5BG3G82&amp;f=ifr&amp;linkID=dc47c96c6d426f3a5588101815234c8c&amp;t=fullsnackde02-20&amp;tracking_id=fullsnackde02-20" width="728" height="90" scrolling="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" style="border:none;" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p></p>



<p>When I started to get into the coding world I immediately started looking for good places to learn online. I&#8217;ve never been a book kind of person and I think learning to code from books is a little &#8220;clunky&#8221; (Leave a comment at the bottom of your opinion). So I surfed around and found:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.codecademy.com/webpack/44e01805165bfde4e6e4322c540abf81.svg" alt="Codecademy logo"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Codecademy (opens in a new tab)">Codecademy</a></p>



<p>This is an amazing resource if you&#8217;re looking to get started in the programming world because it assumes you have no prior knowledge. It has an in-browser editor, step-by-step instructions and good explanations and hints for all the lessons. And best of all, its free! There is a pro version available that gives you access to more help. This site is how I got started in programming and its always my first recommendation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1467"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pluralsight (opens in a new tab)">Pluralsight</a></p>



<p>So after I had been working as a web developer&nbsp;for a year a software company asked if I would join their team as front-end lead. Not knowing anything about software developing I naturally took the job. And that&#8217;s when they recommended I use Pluralsight to get up to speed. It was a monthly membership fee of $15 and I could go through as many tutorials as I wanted and I did. The courses were thorough and clear about all the concepts, terms and syntax. I was able to get up to speed with the company in a matter of days!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1468"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Udemy (opens in a new tab)">Udemy</a></p>



<p>Now I saved this for last because it&#8217;s my favorite and I still use it. I can honestly save I have never learned so much from a website than I have from Udemy. The rating system and recommended courses they gave were exactly what I wanted and although you pay per course, the courses are hugely extensive, thorough, and easy to follow. Stephen Grider is a personal favorite instructor of mine. He really walked me through every step, not leaving any stone unturned. A lot of the courses have expectations that you have some knowledge of the subject but there are courses that will take you from the ground up. Udemy is my top recommendation for learning to code.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1469"/></figure>



<h2>BONUS: Youtube</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Learncode.academy (opens in a new tab)">Learncode.academy</a></p>



<p>There is a world of resources out there for learning to program. All you have to do is Google. Youtube is another place to learn and there are piles of channels dedicated to creating tutorials. Learncode.academy was a channel that I found myself frequently visiting for great tutorials and a range of coding subjects and frameworks.</p>
