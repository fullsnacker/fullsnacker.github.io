<p></p>



<p>As all web developers do, I have a set of tools I use on every web development project.&nbsp; So I thought I would share mine with you. These are tools that I can say with all honesty have greatly increased my efficiency. I should mention that I work primarily with Apple products so some of these tools may not be available for PC users. However, there are <g class="gr_ gr_591 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="591" data-gr-id="591">equilvalents</g>&nbsp;out there.</p>



<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/images.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1488"/></a></figure>



<p>Obviously a code editor is an essential for any programming development stack but I tried a lot of the popular code editors and VS Code is my favourite by far. I started out on Sublime Text and used it all through college and the first two years of my web development career. Then I switch companies and they used WebStorm. I liked it a lot but it wasn&#8217;t free so when I left that company I started trying other editors. I used atom for a while but found it to be a little slow and clunky. Then there was a large movement to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> so I thought I&#8217;d see what all the fuss was about. And after using it for a week I knew why. The speed, the plugins and the built in terminal are just a couple of my favourite features. It&#8217;s now an essential tool in my development belt.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sass&nbsp;(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2000px-Sass_Logo_Color.svg-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1489" width="275" height="206"/></a></figure>



<p>Now as a web developer I spent a lot of time writing CSS. When I was at <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">an FITC</g> (Future Innovations Technology Conference) in Toronto quite a few years ago I went to a talk on <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Now as a web developer I spent a lot of time writing CSS. When I was at an FITC (Future Innovations Technology Conference) in Toronto quite a few years ago I went to a talk on Sass and it changed my development stack forever. I'm not going to go into huge detail about all its features but the site says (opens in a new tab)">Sass</a> and it changed my development stack forever. I&#8217;m not going to go into huge detail about all its features but the site says</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the&nbsp;world.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds incredible functionality. Sass is compiled through a tool called Compass into CSS. The amount of time writing in Sass has saved me is incalculable.</p>



<p>There are other CSS preprocessors like LESS or Stylus but Sass is mine and most people&#8217;s choice.</p>



<h2>Bourbon Neat</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/neat-logo-v2-icon.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1490"/></a></figure>



<p>After integrating Sass into my development stack the question of what grid system should I use arose. I had been playing around with a few other grid systems but when I started tinkering with Neat I immediately knew this was the one. <a href="https://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="After integrating Sass into my development stack the question of what grid system should I use arose. I had been playing around with a few other grid systems but when I started tinkering with Neat I immediately knew this was the one. Bourbon Neat is&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)">Bourbon Neat</a> is&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A lightweight and flexible Sass&nbsp;grid</p></blockquote>



<p>Its simple and doesn&#8217;t use any flex-box (flex-box wasn&#8217;t always stable) but still has incredible&nbsp;customization so it fits every project I build. It uses Sass mixins to set column widths and offsets so I never need to add loads of classes to my HTML.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thoughtbot is the development team that created Neat and they also have some other great tools to checkout like Bourbon and Bitters (there&#8217;s a theme, yes).</p>



<h2>Codekit</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://codekitapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/download-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1492" width="191" height="191"/></a></figure>



<p>This is the ultimate tool! <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is the ultimate tool! Codekit's main purpose is to compile and compress languages down for faster, better development but it does so much more than that. Its browser refresh feature is one of my favorites. I make a change in my code and it automatically recompiles and refreshes my browser. I know that's not revolutionary but it makes it so simple to get back into a project. Just drag your project in and within a couple clicks,&nbsp;you are setup with Sass, Compass, Bourbon Neat etc.&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)" href="https://codekitapp.com/" target="_blank">Codekit</a>&#8216;s main purpose is to compile and compress languages down for faster, better development but it does so much more than that.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Another great feature is that it can take multiple Sass or Javascript files and compile them into one compressed file. A great way to increase load times for your website.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<h2>MAMP</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mamp-pro.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1493" width="179" height="179"/></a></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MAMP is the final piece of the puzzle. According to the website (opens in a new tab)">MAMP</a> is the final piece of the puzzle. According to the website</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>MAMP is a&nbsp;<strong>free, local server</strong>&nbsp;environment that can be installed under&nbsp;<strong>macOS</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;with just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>MAMP turns your computer into a local server so that you can run and test PHP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of my clients want to run the content for their websites so natural I use WordPress as the CMS (content management system). This means that I need to be able to develop in PHP and run MySQL databases. And that&#8217;s exactly way MAMP allows me to do.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Now MAMP does have a paid version but I have never felt the need to pay for it when the free version does exactly what I need. From my understanding, the paid version is just a better interface but if you feel that the pro version is essential, let me know it the comments.

<p>MAMP is a mac product but I know there are PC tools that do the same, such as LAMP.</p>



<p>Those are my top 5 essential web development tools. If you have other tools that you use on every project I would love to hear about them. Always down to add or replace tools with better ones. Let&#8217;s keep making our code DRYer and our development time shorter!</p>
