					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful blog! Do you have any hints for aspiring writers? I&#039;m planning to start my own website soon but I&#039;m a little lost on everything. Would you advise starting with a free platform like Wordpress or go for a paid option? There are so many options out there that I&#039;m totally overwhelmed .. Any recommendations? Appreciate it!]]></description>
