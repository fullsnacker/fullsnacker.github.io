<p>You want to learn to program but don&#8217;t know where to start. You want to level up your skills but you don&#8217;t have a mentor. You want to learn how to make an application with authentication. The list can go on and on and they all have the same answer; tutorials.</p>



<p>There are piles of free and paid tutorials out there which makes it hard to find the really good ones. I have gone through countless tutorials on multiple different sites but the one I keep going back to is Udemy.</p>



<p>Udemy has taught me so much and I attribute a huge amount of my success to all the awesome courses that they offer. You&#8217;ll notice that I prefer certain instructors and you can find them at the end of this article. I would recommend any of the courses they offer.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/javascript-advanced/" target="_blank">Advanced JavaScript</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12311" width="244" height="137" srcset="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg 480w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></figure>



<p>There are a lot of free hello world tutorials out there for learning Javascript but after learning the basics I was looking for a way to level up. This course takes you through and explains the basics as well as advanced concepts in JavaScript. Understanding even the basics in a detailed way helped me understand how the language works on a deeper level. If you&#8217;re looking to level up your JS skills this course if for you.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Node with React (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/" target="_blank">Node with React</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1254420_f6cb_4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2742"/></figure>



<p>You guys know how much I love React. Well, this course was the beginning for me. I learned from start to finish, project structure, life cycle methods, processing payments, setting up a node server and all the rest. This is an incredibly thorough course that breaks down even the most complex concepts into understandable bites. If you want to learn React this is the one I would recommend the most. As a note, he uses a Mongo DB for the database which I recommend as well and I have a course for it further down.</p>

<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="React Redux Firebase (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-firebase/" target="_blank">React Redux Firebase</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1532232_1cdc_8.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2743"/></figure>



<p>Working with Mongo is awesome but it does require a backend server so when I found out about Firebase and that its serverless I hoped on. And obviously, I&#8217;m going to use React as the frontend but state management can be a lot but Redux is so good for it. This course shows how to make them all work together and the flow has been one that I&#8217;ve used in multiple projects. If you&#8217;re looking to work with these frameworks, I would highly recommend this course.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/" target="_blank">Mongo DB</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1000574_06cb.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2745"/></figure>



<p>One of the first web development jobs was working on an application that used Mongo DB it holds a special place in my heart. And I have used other databases but I always come back to Mongo. This course shows you how to manage and utilize all the amazing capabilities that Mongo DB offers. He does a great job of explaining what he&#8217;s doing as he&#8217;s doing it and is really easy to follow. If you&#8217;re going to start using Mongo DB, this course is what you need.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Angular 8 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/" target="_blank">Angular 8</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/756150_c033_2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2746"/></figure>



<p>Now you guys know I&#8217;m all about React but recently I had to learn Angular 8 for a project. Although I was reluctant, tools and tools and I&#8217;ve learned not to smack talk other frameworks and actually gained an appreciation for Angular. This was the course that I crashed through to ramp on the project and it was a great experience. This course takes you from start to finish on how to use the framework as well as all the tools that the CLI offers to make development that much faster. So If you want to get started in Angular this course if a home run.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bonus Ionic 4 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/ionic-2-the-practical-guide-to-building-ios-android-apps/" target="_blank">Bonus Ionic 4</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1070124_3a0f_3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2747"/></figure>



<p>For the project that I was referring to in the above article, we were also using ionic to develop. So Ionic 4 was on the roster for the ramp up and obviously, I went straight to Udemy. This course was an awesome find. After going through it myself I sent it to my coworkers and they also found it super helpful. He shows you all the capabilities of the framework and how to get your project showing up on your phone in no time. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Ionic, it&#8217;s a framework that turns your web development project into a native app. It originally was only for Angular but recently just released support for React and Vue. So if you want to turn to web development skills into native app development this course is a great option.</p>

<h2>Recommended Instructors</h2>



<p>My two favorite instructors on Udemy are Stephen Grider and Maximilian Schwarzmüller. Both do an incredible job of explaining complex concepts in an understandable way, create interesting and useful projects that incorporate all the lessons taught and are easy to follow. If I haven&#8217;t recommended a course that is in your field of interest, I would recommend any of the courses they offer. Both have a vast collection of videos in a plethora of different programming languages.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope you find these suggestions helpful and if I&#8217;ve missed a great course please leave a comment with a link. I would love to hear your guy&#8217;s suggestions.</p>

<p>Years ago when I first wanted to learn to program, I thought, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Well, the first thing I need is a code editor.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>So I googled to best code editor of the day. Through a bunch of searching I found an editor called Sublime and at that time it was. I always like to think that I started using it before it became mainstream (the hipster in me lol). </p>



<p>Having a design background, first things first- this needs to look prettier. And so, the search for the best theme began. To this day, although the editor itself may have changed, the desire to find a better, cooler theme still lives within me. As I&#8217;m sure it does in you as well.</p>



<p>Below are some of the best themes I&#8217;ve worked with. I&#8217;m a guy that likes to switch it up a lot but I&#8217;m always picking one of these themes. If I&#8217;ve missed one that you think should be on the list, please leave a comment with the name of it! I would love to check it out and maybe update this list.</p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Synth Wave &#8217;84</a></h2>



<p>I&#8217;m coming out the gate swinging. This is by far the coolest theme that I have ever used. Synth Wave &#8217;84 has awesome neon colors, wild gradients and the best of all is&#8230; the text flipping GLOWS! This theme would do the new season of Stranger Things incredible justice. </p>



<p>The setup of this theme is a touch more involved than most but believe me it&#8217;s worth it. You can <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">get install instructions here!</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/theme.jpg?fit=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2521"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Night Owl</a></h2>



<p>Night Owl was a random find when I was looking up how to make my own theme but was so good I stopped trying. This one has been my go to theme for the longest time probably because I love the idea of a theme design specifically for me, a Night Owl:)</p>



<p>Now I know, heaven forbid I use a light theme, but sometimes when I work outside, I have to. And the nice thing about the Night Owl theme is that it has a complimentary light theme in the same palette. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Check it out here!</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Material Theme</a></h2>



<p>This theme dates right back to the beginning for me. My absolute favorite theme for Sublime was a material theme. As I worked my way through different editors, the material theme is always one I looked for. So naturally, when I landed on Visual Studio Code, I immediately searched for Material Theme. For Me, Material Theme is the standard with a little nostalgia so I don&#8217;t know if it can ever come off my list.</p>



<p>Also, you can download the accompanying icon set which takes the theme to a new level! <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">See what you think.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-7.43.45-AM.png?fit=1024%2C625&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2526"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wonderpanda.arbiter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Arbiter</a></h2>



<p>Now, this is a particularly awesome theme because I work with the guy that made it! Now I&#8217;m pretty selective about what themes I use but Jesse (WonderPanda) nailed this one and we use it company wide! It&#8217;s easy on the eyes but still very visible. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wonderpanda.arbiter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">See for yourself!</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mariorodeghiero.vue-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Vue Theme</a></h2>



<p>Obviously, if you&#8217;re a fan of Vue you&#8217;re going to love this theme. I really enjoy the color choices as well as some line highlighting to show where braces open and close. Overall its a solid theme for when I&#8217;m looking to change things up. Maybe it&#8217;ll be your fav! <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mariorodeghiero.vue-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">You can see it here.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/example.png?fit=1024%2C489&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2529"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Slack Theme (Bonus Fun)</a></h2>



<p>Now I don&#8217;t know if I would seriously use this one but I thought it was hilarious when I first stumbled upon it; a Visual Studio Code theme that looks like Slack. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Check it out here</a> and let me know if you start using it full time. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve been hunting for good themes for years and the hunt for better will always continue but hopefully, this article has been helpful and that you were able to find a Visual Studio Code theme that fit your needs and pleased your eyes. I think these are the best VS Code themes of 2019 but if you think you have a better one, through it in the comments and I&#8217;ll check it out. One of these days I&#8217;ll have to make my own:)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everybody loves more screen space, especially programmers. And in today’s work environment most development teams and coders work off laptops (usually Macs). So the real struggle is finding more of it. As soon as I sit down, I immediately look for an external monitor to plug into. If possible to connect to two monitors, then I am really in luck. But the white whale of laptop setups is connecting three monitors to one laptop. Today, I’m going to share how I did it!</p>



<h2>Computer</h2>



<p>First things first, your computer has got to be able to handle the number of pixels it&#8217;s going to be pushing. I’m letting you know right off the hop, a 13” MacBook Pro cannot handle three displays regardless of the resolution. Two is the max, but you can keep the laptop open so it like 2.5 monitors.</p>



<p>I got my triple monitor setup working with my 15”, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB memory, Radeon Pro 450 2 GB Intel HD Graphics 530 1536 MB, MacBook Pro. If you would like to know everything I use in my setup, check out my article on it at <a href="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/">https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/</a>. <br></p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>



<h2>Dongle</h2>



<p>One of the most important things about making the triple monitor setup work is the dongle. Now I’m going to save my rant on the dongle life for another time but you need to choose the right dongle. I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KafG3b">iHaper USB-C hub</a> because it’s the one I use and its worked great. If you go with another dongle/hub, make sure that it has at least one HDMI port (for monitor), one USB-C port (for power), and one standard USB port (for keyboard). </p>



<h2>Cables</h2>



<p>This is one that I think a lot of people don’t think of when they’re getting their setup wired. Since the MacBook Pro’s only have USB-C inputs you either have to use a converter to connect your HDMI monitor or, and this is the one I use, you buy <a href="https://amzn.to/2XlNReJ">HDMI to USB-C cables</a>. You will also need just a regular HDMI cable as well that will plug into the dongle.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>



<h2>Monitors</h2>



<p>Three monitors is the max that a 15” MacBook Pro can handle but only one can be 4k. The others need to be 1080p. You can, however, have the laptop open as another display. 13” MacBooks can only handle two external displays and they cannot be 4k. If you’re more interested in quality then, you can connect two 4k monitors to your 15” MacBook.</p>



<h2>Laptop Stand</h2>



<p>This is not necessary but if you’re like me and like to keep the desk clutter to a minimum, it&#8217;s a huge help. I use the<a href="https://amzn.to/2WImCX2"> Arc upright laptop stand</a>. It keeps the cable chaos under control as well as looking pretty cool.</p>

<p>Finding inspiration for any design is key. Whether it&#8217;s nature, the way a building looks or from other websites. These are the 3 main websites that I use on a consistent basis when I need inspiration for a website I&#8217;m designing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll say this right off the bat, I do not believe is ripping someone&#8217;s&nbsp;work off. Changing a few photos and <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="5" data-gr-id="5">a font</g> isn&#8217;t enough. Finding pieces of different sites that you like and putting them together is the way to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dribbble</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve loved game development ever since I started programming. I ultimately found my career path in web development but I still really enjoy creating phone games. A couple made it to the app store but a many didn&#8217;t (I didn&#8217;t keep up with Apple&#8217;s app license so none are live now). So I thought I&#8217;d show the demos of all the games in the video above. All games were developed in ActionScript 3 and then compiled to iOS or Android through a tool called Air. All assets and development were done by yours truly.</p>

<p></p>



<h2>Tiny Planet</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Tiny Planet Intro - Mobile Game" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmoiiutVwj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Tiny Planet with a game I created as a final project when I was in college for interactive media development. The video above is the intro to the game. I created all the assets in 3D Studio Max and then exported them out as images and made sprites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective of the game is to keep the missiles from striking earth by blocking them with a barge type spaceship for as long as you can. Tapping on the right and left of the screen propels the ship with momentum around the earth. There are also power ups that help you survive longer. The glowing ball-type objects are force fields that will protect from a single missile hit. The boxes are EMPs. When you swipe up (on mobile) or click one in the corner, a pulse goes destroying all missiles on the screen.</p>



<p>This was one of my <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">favourite</g> games to develop because it used a bunch of different fields like, 3D animation, graphic design, programming etc.</p>



<h2>Beaver Boy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-9.24.19-AM-1024x678.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1522"/></figure>



<p>The most Canadian game possible. You are a beaver wearing a toque that drinks maple syrup for energy to chew through trees. The power up is when you grab a maple leaf you get a birch canoe and paddle very fast with a hockey stick. It&#8217;s also always snowing. The only thing I missed was saying sorry when you lose and having a polar bear in there (maybe in Beaver Boy 2 lol).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a Canadian I thought it would be funny to make a game that played to all the stereotypes. You tap as fast as you can to chew through the oncoming trees that will push you back and out of frame. As you chew your energy syrup goes down so you need to jump up and grab some more. Every so often you can grab a maple leaf which will make you invincible for 10 seconds. The point of the game is to chew through as many trees as possible.</p>



<h2>Toaster Boy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.34.22-PM-736x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1533" width="329" height="457"/></figure>



<p>This one has the exact same favour as Flappy Bird, incredible frustrating but very addictive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is simple. Pop the toast out of the toaster and try to tap right when he enters the toaster again to bounce him out. Bounce him as many times as you can. The more you bounce him the higher he will go until he floats out into space. But believe me if you could get him into space you are not human.</p>



<p>This was fast little game that I would eventually love to get on the store. It was super fun to make and play.</p>

<p></p>



<h2>Robo-Gorilla</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="FullComp 1" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7iBfxzo9aSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This game was another final project for school. I designed all the piece of Robo-Gorilla in Adobe illustrator and then used a tool called Dragon Bones to animate him in the games.</p>



<p>I created a short animation in after effects to tell the story of Robo-Gorilla. Captured in the jungle and taken back to a lab, scientists weaponized him with guns and armour. Enraged when he woke up, Robo-Gorilla goes on a rampage to try and escape the facility.</p>



<p>There was a lot more I wanted to add to the game like different characters and power-ups but it was still a fun prototype.</p>



<h2>Jungle Jim</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.27.55-PM-1024x641.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1525"/></figure>



<p>I made this game on my reading week. Every single frame was hand drawn and coloured (time consuming) but I liked the effect.</p>



<p>The point of the game is to eat as many flies as you can but beware of snakes in the tree that will eat you. You can avoid the snakes by either going invisible or swiping down (on mobile) and going to the under side of the tree. I spent most of my time on the drawings so those features never go ironed out. Creating those animations was really fun though.</p>



<h2>Jack Astro</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.32.31-PM-746x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1531" width="302" height="414"/></figure>



<p>This game was a partnership between my brother and I. I was down visiting him in Toronto during my reading week and we created this game, a squirrel flying through space collecting acorns, avoiding asteroids and blasting through everything will a NOS jet pack. Sounds about as nutty as my brother and I are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We created the assets together and I developed it. The point of the game was to survive as long as possible without getting hit by an asteroid. You would collect acorns which you could then use to buy better handle on your jet pack or more NOS slots.</p>



<p>I still think this game has great potential and it is for sure one of my personal favorites.</p>



<h2>The Mail Room</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.29.46-PM-1-722x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1529" width="333" height="471"/></figure>



<p>This was a quick little game I made over a weekend. Different coloured letters fall from a shoot and you have to tap to rotate the funnel with the correct colour to catch the letter, a kind of sorting reaction-type game. Every so often a parcel falls and you have to swipe it out of the way (on mobile).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The graphics were fun to design and I enjoyed getting a quick hit of game development out.</p>



<p>Well those are some of the games that I&#8217;ve developed that didn&#8217;t make it to the app store. I have more but I&#8217;ll show those to you all a different time. Hope you enjoyed and let me know what your favourite game in the comments.</p>

<p>Being in the field of development for several years, one of the most common questions I get asked is, &#8220;What&#8217;s your best advice for someone learning to program?&#8221;. So I&#8217;ve put together my top 5 pieces of advice that I found most helpful in my career in programming. Hopefully you find them helpful as well and if you have any other advice to add, please leave a comment!</p>



<h2>What do you want to program?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-1024x574.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12320" srcset="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-1024x574.png 1024w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-300x168.png 300w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280-768x431.png 768w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wordpress-3288420_1280.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This first one here might not sound like advice but it really is. Many people come into the field wanting to start programming but don&#8217;t realize the amount languages and directions you can take with code. I&#8217;ll tell you right now you cannot do them all, so picking a direction is crucial.</p>



<p>For me, I started my career as a graphic designer which quickly transition into web development. I had done some preliminary app development before that but found myself thoroughly enjoying web development more and more. So HTML, CSS, and Javascript were the languages to learn. After getting well versed in those I moved on to SASS, PHP and MySQL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had chosen app development my choice of programming languages would have <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">be</g>en very different. I&#8217;m not going to go into all the languages related to each field but it is important to ask yourself that question and find the answer.</p>



<iframe src="//rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?o=15&amp;p=13&amp;l=ur1&amp;category=gift_certificates&amp;banner=0KWQVXX8ESSVZYF450G2&amp;f=ifr&amp;linkID=04ab7ee1d4a078a5cdd9389de683764f&amp;t=fullsnackde02-20&amp;tracking_id=fullsnackde02-20" width="468" height="60" scrolling="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" style="border:none;" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p></p>



<h2>Just start</h2>



<p>This is probably my favorite piece of advice on coding and life in general. Just start. Honestly, if you want to do something you have to start. I understand something you can&#8217;t just do right away, but start doing something to get you there. Take steps in the direction you want to go. Don&#8217;t tell me you really want to be a programmer. Start coding. There are piles of resources from learning and expanding your knowledge.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The best way to learn something is to get your hands dirty with it.</p><cite><br></cite></blockquote>



<p>If you want to start programming or want to learn a new framework or different language, just start. Download a text editor and start writing some code.</p>



<h2>From the ground up</h2>



<p>Someone asked me if they should start learning a library first rather than the base language because the library was easier. And as I always say, start from the ground up.</p>



<p>When I was first learning to program, I didn&#8217;t want to use <strong>ANY</strong> libraries or frameworks. I wanted to write every piece of code myself so I knew exactly what everything was doing. Looking back I realize that was a little zealous and unrealistic but I believe the underlying drive was good.</p>



<p>Knowing the basics and being able to code in the vanilla language is crucial in my opinion to becoming a better programmer.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Trying to learn frameworks and libraries without starting with the base languages is like trying to build a house without a foundation.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Try things</h2>



<p>One of the best ways to learn how to code or learn a new framework or library is through tutorials.&nbsp;The amount of free education in the field of programming is astounding and if you want to know my top recommendations for where to learn you can check out my article on the subject&nbsp;<a href="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/13/the-best-3-resources-to-learn-how-to-code/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Tutorials are amazing but just going through a tutorial is not enough. You need to mess around with it, try different things, make it do something else. This is the probably my number one tip for learning how to code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can honestly say I learn so much more when I do variations of a tutorial than just leaving it at what was shown. I often find several related tutorials and then try and combine them to create what I want to create. Now, this stems back to my first point of knowing what you want to program.</p>



<p>For example, when I started learning the React framework I went through a tutorial that showed me the basics as well as a tutorial that showed me how to make API calls. I combined the two tutorials to create a simple web app that pulled my profile and feed data from Instagram. I learned so much more from trying to get that app to work than just going through the tutorial. Learning like this helps you to really understand what is going on rather than just following along.</p>



<figure><iframe src="//rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?o=15&amp;p=13&amp;l=ur1&amp;category=gift_certificates&amp;banner=0KWQVXX8ESSVZYF450G2&amp;f=ifr&amp;linkID=04ab7ee1d4a078a5cdd9389de683764f&amp;t=fullsnackde02-20&amp;tracking_id=fullsnackde02-20" width="468" height="60"></iframe></figure>



<p></p>



<h2>Start Simple</h2>



<p>In my example above, I started learning the React framework by building a super simple app that just pulled information from Instagram&#8217;s API. Understanding the basics is huge as I mentioned in my point about starting from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biting off more than you can chew is something that I have and often am guilty of. It&#8217;s important when learning code not to get overwhelmed because, no matter what language you start with, it&#8217;s a lot of information to take in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making small wins is crucial in a developer&#8217;s career because it&#8217;s those moments that will push you on through the next challenge. Getting &#8220;Hello World&#8221; to show up on a screen in rewarding!</p>



<h2>You got to love it</h2>



<p>This is an extra point but it&#8217;s one I love throwing in at the end. You have got to love it. Coding is hours and days and months and years of learning. It takes a tremendous amount of time to become fluent in coding and even longer to become an expert. All that to say that it is an incredibly&nbsp;rewarding field that allows you to create amazing, beautiful and useful things that you can share with the world.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As all web developers do, I have a set of tools I use on every web development project.&nbsp; So I thought I would share mine with you. These are tools that I can say with all honesty have greatly increased my efficiency. I should mention that I work primarily with Apple products so some of these tools may not be available for PC users. However, there are <g class="gr_ gr_591 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="591" data-gr-id="591">equilvalents</g>&nbsp;out there.</p>



<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/images.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1488"/></a></figure>



<p>Obviously a code editor is an essential for any programming development stack but I tried a lot of the popular code editors and VS Code is my favourite by far. I started out on Sublime Text and used it all through college and the first two years of my web development career. Then I switch companies and they used WebStorm. I liked it a lot but it wasn&#8217;t free so when I left that company I started trying other editors. I used atom for a while but found it to be a little slow and clunky. Then there was a large movement to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> so I thought I&#8217;d see what all the fuss was about. And after using it for a week I knew why. The speed, the plugins and the built in terminal are just a couple of my favourite features. It&#8217;s now an essential tool in my development belt.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sass&nbsp;(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2000px-Sass_Logo_Color.svg-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1489" width="275" height="206"/></a></figure>



<p>Now as a web developer I spent a lot of time writing CSS. When I was at <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">an FITC</g> (Future Innovations Technology Conference) in Toronto quite a few years ago I went to a talk on <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Now as a web developer I spent a lot of time writing CSS. When I was at an FITC (Future Innovations Technology Conference) in Toronto quite a few years ago I went to a talk on Sass and it changed my development stack forever. I'm not going to go into huge detail about all its features but the site says (opens in a new tab)">Sass</a> and it changed my development stack forever. I&#8217;m not going to go into huge detail about all its features but the site says</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the&nbsp;world.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds incredible functionality. Sass is compiled through a tool called Compass into CSS. The amount of time writing in Sass has saved me is incalculable.</p>



<p>There are other CSS preprocessors like LESS or Stylus but Sass is mine and most people&#8217;s choice.</p>



<h2>Bourbon Neat</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/neat-logo-v2-icon.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1490"/></a></figure>



<p>After integrating Sass into my development stack the question of what grid system should I use arose. I had been playing around with a few other grid systems but when I started tinkering with Neat I immediately knew this was the one. <a href="https://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="After integrating Sass into my development stack the question of what grid system should I use arose.

Bourbon Neat is&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)">Bourbon Neat</a> is&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A lightweight and flexible Sass&nbsp;grid</p></blockquote>



<p>Its simple and doesn&#8217;t use any flex-box (flex-box wasn&#8217;t always stable) but still has incredible&nbsp;customization so it fits every project I build. It uses Sass mixins to set column widths and offsets so I never need to add loads of classes to my HTML.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thoughtbot is the development team that created Neat and they also have some other great tools to checkout like Bourbon and Bitters (there&#8217;s a theme, yes).</p>



<h2>Codekit</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://codekitapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/download-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1492" width="191" height="191"/></a></figure>



<p>This is the ultimate tool! <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is the ultimate tool! Codekit's main purpose is to compile and compress languages down for faster, better development but it does so much more than that. Its browser refresh feature is one of my favorites.

<h2>MAMP</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mamp-pro.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1493" width="179" height="179"/></a></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MAMP is the final piece of the puzzle. According to the website (opens in a new tab)">MAMP</a> is the final piece of the puzzle. According to the website</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>MAMP is a&nbsp;<strong>free, local server</strong>&nbsp;environment that can be installed under&nbsp;<strong>macOS</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;with just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>MAMP turns your computer into a local server so that you can run and test PHP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of my clients want to run the content for their websites so natural I use WordPress as the CMS (content management system). This means that I need to be able to develop in PHP and run MySQL databases. And that&#8217;s exactly way MAMP allows me to do.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Now MAMP does have a paid version but I have never felt the need to pay for it when the free version does exactly what I need.

<p>MAMP is a mac product but I know there are PC tools that do the same, such as LAMP.</p>



<p>Those are my top 5 essential web development tools. If you have other tools that you use on every project I would love to hear about them. Always down to add or replace tools with better ones. Let&#8217;s keep making our code DRYer and our development time shorter!</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I love to longboard, record music, paint, craft, workout, code, design while running two businesses and still have a social life, so time management is something I had to figure out. These are my three tips for managing your time better.</p>



<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>



<h2>Focus</h2>



<p>Now I know this may seem a super general but give me a second to explain. There is a misconception that multitasking is the most effective way to get things done but that&#8217;s not the case. Your brain can only think about one thing at a time, the variable (how good at multitasking you are) is how fast your brain can flip between subjects. And it&#8217;s in these times of flipping back and forth when <g class="gr_ gr_117 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="117" data-gr-id="117">valuable</g> time is lost.</p>



<p>I had a great interview with Mitch from <a href="https://codingwithmitch.com/">CodingWithMitch</a>&nbsp;and the subject of time management came up. He had a great analogy about focus. He said</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Imagine you&#8217;re stacking Jenga blocks. You keep stacking them up higher and higher. Then someone comes along and smacks the whole tower down. And you start stacking the blocks back up again.</p></blockquote>



<p>The blocks are your thought process. When you are undisturbed and focusing on one subject (in this case code) you can stack your thought blocks very high. But when someone interrupts and you have to flip between subjects, you are forced to start stacking all over again.</p>



<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s not realistic to think that you could never go undisturbed once you start working but setting blocks of time to be intentionally focused on one project or problem can be hugely beneficial for your productivity.</p>



<h2>Removing Time Wasters</h2>



<p>All my life I&#8217;ve been told that I have too much time on my hands. This always irked me a little because we all the the same amount of time on our hands. We all have 24 hours in a day.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We all have the same amount of time on our hands. Do things that don&#8217;t waste it.</p></blockquote>



<p>But it got me to thinking about why people feel this way. What I found was that people (including myself) have things in there life that eat away at their time when they don&#8217;t notice, making them feel as though others have more time than they do.</p>



<p>The key is to remove these time wasters. For me it was watching endless Facebook videos. I found myself wasters hours just watching meaningless videos and feeling unsatisfied afterwards. I removed the Facebook app from my phone and found hours of my life back!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m not saying you have to cut Netflix and social apps from your life but being more mindful of things that are prone to waste your time can help you make your time more <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="3" data-gr-id="3">effective</g>. And this perfectly flows into my next and last tip.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Change Your Mentality</h2>



<p>Time management isn&#8217;t about finding more time to work it&#8217;s about finding a proper balance between working and resting. What I was finding was that time wasters were not helping me rest or work but merely distracting me from things that I really wanted to be doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how do determine if something is helping you rest or just waste your <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">time.</g>&nbsp;And this is where you need to change your mentality. The question to ask yourself is&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Does this add value to my life?</p></blockquote>



<p>I doesn&#8217;t have to be work but does this help me relax, or am I investing in a relationship or myself. The answer to that question will help you determine if that&#8217;s something you need/want or whether it&#8217;s just a distraction. Sometimes an episode of New Girl is a great way to unwind from a crazy day. </p>



<p>The key is to evaluate the ways you spend your time and in doing so you will see the areas where you are productive and the ways you waste your time. Change your mentality in this way and you&#8217;ll see that you&#8217;ll become more productive with your time in work and in relaxation.</p>

<iframe src="//rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?o=15&amp;p=48&amp;l=ur1&amp;category=electronics&amp;banner=15REZK87RT5BF5BG3G82&amp;f=ifr&amp;linkID=dc47c96c6d426f3a5588101815234c8c&amp;t=fullsnackde02-20&amp;tracking_id=fullsnackde02-20" width="728" height="90" scrolling="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" style="border:none;" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p></p>



<p>When I started to get into the coding world I immediately started looking for good places to learn online. I&#8217;ve never been a book kind of person and I think learning to code from books is a little &#8220;clunky&#8221; (Leave a comment at the bottom of your opinion). So I surfed around and found:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.codecademy.com/webpack/44e01805165bfde4e6e4322c540abf81.svg" alt="Codecademy logo"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Codecademy (opens in a new tab)">Codecademy</a></p>



<p>This is an amazing resource if you&#8217;re looking to get started in the programming world because it assumes you have no prior knowledge. It has an in-browser editor, step-by-step instructions and good explanations and hints for all the lessons. And best of all, its free! There is a pro version available that gives you access to more help. This site is how I got started in programming and its always my first recommendation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1467"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pluralsight (opens in a new tab)">Pluralsight</a></p>



<p>So after I had been working as a web developer&nbsp;for a year a software company asked if I would join their team as front-end lead. Not knowing anything about software developing I naturally took the job. And that&#8217;s when they recommended I use Pluralsight to get up to speed. It was a monthly membership fee of $15 and I could go through as many tutorials as I wanted and I did. The courses were thorough and clear about all the concepts, terms and syntax. I was able to get up to speed with the company in a matter of days!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1468"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Udemy (opens in a new tab)">Udemy</a></p>



<p>Now I saved this for last because it&#8217;s my favorite and I still use it. I can honestly save I have never learned so much from a website than I have from Udemy. The rating system and recommended courses they gave were exactly what I wanted and although you pay per course, the courses are hugely extensive, thorough, and easy to follow. Stephen Grider is a personal favorite instructor of mine. He really walked me through every step, not leaving any stone unturned. A lot of the courses have expectations that you have some knowledge of the subject but there are courses that will take you from the ground up. Udemy is my top recommendation for learning to code.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1469"/></figure>



<h2>BONUS: Youtube</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Learncode.academy (opens in a new tab)">Learncode.academy</a></p>



<p>There is a world of resources out there for learning to program. All you have to do is Google. Youtube is another place to learn and there are piles of channels dedicated to creating tutorials. Learncode.academy was a channel that I found myself frequently visiting for great tutorials and a range of coding subjects and frameworks.</p>

So I got 2 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="I could just work off a laptop but I need more screen space than 15 inches. So I got 2 Samsung 27&quot; LED monitors. Now, the 27-inch model is no longer available in the US but you can get the 23.5-inch model. They aren't 4k which I kind of wish they were (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F9UBSV0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01F9UBSV0&amp;linkId=4ef3d9d403717a32cb0b5cab90dd36f5" target="_blank">Samsung 27&#8243; LED monitors</a>. They aren&#8217;t 4k which I kind of wish they were but when I&#8217;m just writing code I don&#8217;t need the ultra high definition. In the future I&#8217;d love to upgrade.</p>



<h2>Monitor Stand</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07B6F1MYY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=6685fb3907ff74c216e86b16a7686e42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>So I had both monitors just sitting on my desk and the stands they were on took up half of it so I immediately head to Amazon for a solution. Right away I found Vivo and their incredible line of products. I purchased my <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07B6F1MYY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=5b41d62f36f7bf48bd3fa3a10211bf13">Vivo dual monitor mount</a> and could not be more pleased with a product. I got so much desk space back and actually helped with my posture because I was able to raise the screen to a better height. Truly a king-pin of my setup.</p>



<h2>HDMI to USB-C</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07CGCQTQ3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07CGCQTQ3&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=e7fa3b39dba5b0de37eb4f146e30dece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B07CGCQTQ3&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>I get asked a lot how I am able to have dual monitors with a MacBook Pro and the answer is super simple, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01LYS3Q5A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01LYS3Q5A&amp;linkId=46f8bf55424058d9b04edd7839ac8866">HDMI to USBC cable</a>. I just plug the HDMI end into the monitor and the USBC end into my Mac and it works. I go into Settings &gt; Display and adjust the layout and we&#8217;re rolling.</p>



<h2>Keyboard</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B071J5WTT6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=e295dcbe1b7306c1ca1ad83a3eb0c3b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Another cornerstone of my setup is my keyboard because as we all know, a programmers number one tool is their keyboard. I had been using a <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="8" data-gr-id="8">Razor</g> Black Widow Tournament Edition for quite some time and really enjoyed it. Then I moved to an X-bow Ergonomic Keyboard for a couple months until I switched to what I use now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071J5WTT6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackdeve-20&amp;linkId=6c1973b6afcf988e8807951efbd7d6ca">Vortex Race 3</a>. I got it with silent red switches because I love reds but I also work in a co-working office (so a loud keyboard isn&#8217;t very welcome). I can honestly say this is my keyboard for life. I know many other programmers as well that swear by it.</p>



<h2>Key Caps</h2>



<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076Q1DC4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B076Q1DC4Q&amp;linkId=541f3fe2f9a514c36d074684db65f5ec"><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/715SFoTOruL._SL1500_-1-e1544636707299-1024x616.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1457" width="376" height="225"></figure></a>



<p>But obviously, I can just leave something with the stock setup. Even though the original keycaps are amazing I had to customize. So being the very extra person I am, I got <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076Q1DC4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B076Q1DC4Q&amp;linkId=4caf469bbaa4576135c6ca0a50fadd02">golden keycaps</a> to really &#8220;pimp out&#8221; my keyboard. Being extra is a necessity for me.</p>



<h2>Mouse</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B016QO5YNG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=3734e50ff42065e9832aa81a2e34b33c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Most programmers that pride in the fact that they don&#8217;t need to use a mouse at all but as I also do a lot of graphic design, its used an equal amount. I&#8217;ve had my <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B016QO5YNG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;linkId=496b15d4a1943248995fbc8786935ae5">magic mouse</a> for over 9 years and it works flawlessly which I think is a huge testament to the quality of the product. Having the touch features and being able to swipe through multiple desktops has been <strong>so</strong> essential to my workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrist Pads</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004D8PYE2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=79c76c09c0abae56def6ad82d311d136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Keeping my setup ergonomic is key because I spend full days at my desk. I have struggled in the past with shoulder numbness and carpal tunnel so having proper wrist support is a must. I use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004D8PYE2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;linkId=d70af354626804d7c981f036b41027ce">Grifiti Fat Wrist Pads</a> for my mouse and keyboard and I haven&#8217;t had any pain.</p>



<h2>Headphones</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MQWUXZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=3b58c47897e335f1aa0e9e231ff25aae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>As all good programmers do, I need quiet, undistracted focused to be able to code to the best of my abilities. But as I mentioned before, I work in a co-working space, so silence is rare.&nbsp; The solution: headphones. And there is no better solution that <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MQWUXZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;linkId=9ea10abf0b2a37541ae61981e8bf3b82">AirPods</a>. I was a skeptic of them at first but my friends kept raving about them so I took a chance and got some. I was not disappointed. They rarely leave my ears. I can wear them for a full day and my ears don&#8217;t get sore at all (which is usually a problem for me).&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Standing Mat</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00V3TO9EK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B00V3TO9EK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=a93d3814d491db5282b0cf7827f8af68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B00V3TO9EK&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The final piece to my setup is my standing mat. I have a sit-to-stand desk which has been incredible for productivity and mood but having high-arched feet, they get fatigued quickly. The <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00V3TO9EK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00V3TO9EK&amp;linkId=b78ed44597cf6a0d8737814dbfc4771b"><g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">ErgoDriven</g> Standing Mat</a> has an amazing design to help counter standing fatigue and improve posture. I am able to move around on it and even massage my feet while I work. An essential piece to my computer setup.</p>



<p>If you guys have more questions about my setup or thoughts on any of these products I&#8217;d love to hear about them in the comments. My setup is constantly changing so I&#8217;ll keep you updated when I switch things up.</p>
