<p>You want to learn to program but don&#8217;t know where to start. You want to level up your skills but you don&#8217;t have a mentor. You want to learn how to make an application with authentication. The list can go on and on and they all have the same answer; tutorials.</p>



<p>There are piles of free and paid tutorials out there which makes it hard to find the really good ones. I have gone through countless tutorials on multiple different sites but the one I keep going back to is Udemy.</p>



<p>Udemy has taught me so much and I attribute a huge amount of my success to all the awesome courses that they offer. You&#8217;ll notice that I prefer certain instructors and you can find them at the end of this article. I would recommend any of the courses they offer.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/javascript-advanced/" target="_blank">Advanced JavaScript</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12311" width="244" height="137" srcset="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg 480w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></figure>



<p>There are a lot of free hello world tutorials out there for learning Javascript but after learning the basics I was looking for a way to level up. This course takes you through and explains the basics as well as advanced concepts in JavaScript. Understanding even the basics in a detailed way helped me understand how the language works on a deeper level. If you&#8217;re looking to level up your JS skills this course if for you.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Node with React (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/" target="_blank">Node with React</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1254420_f6cb_4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2742"/></figure>



<p>You guys know how much I love React. Well, this course was the beginning for me. I learned from start to finish, project structure, life cycle methods, processing payments, setting up a node server and all the rest. This is an incredibly thorough course that breaks down even the most complex concepts into understandable bites. If you want to learn React this is the one I would recommend the most. As a note, he uses a Mongo DB for the database which I recommend as well and I have a course for it further down.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="React Redux Firebase (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-firebase/" target="_blank">React Redux Firebase</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1532232_1cdc_8.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2743"/></figure>



<p>Working with Mongo is awesome but it does require a backend server so when I found out about Firebase and that its serverless I hoped on. And obviously, I&#8217;m going to use React as the frontend but state management can be a lot but Redux is so good for it. This course shows how to make them all work together and the flow has been one that I&#8217;ve used in multiple projects. If you&#8217;re looking to work with these frameworks, I would highly recommend this course.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/" target="_blank">Mongo DB</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1000574_06cb.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2745"/></figure>



<p>One of the first web development jobs was working on an application that used Mongo DB it holds a special place in my heart. And I have used other databases but I always come back to Mongo. This course shows you how to manage and utilize all the amazing capabilities that Mongo DB offers. He does a great job of explaining what he&#8217;s doing as he&#8217;s doing it and is really easy to follow. If you&#8217;re going to start using Mongo DB, this course is what you need.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Angular 8 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/" target="_blank">Angular 8</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/756150_c033_2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2746"/></figure>



<p>Now you guys know I&#8217;m all about React but recently I had to learn Angular 8 for a project. Although I was reluctant, tools and tools and I&#8217;ve learned not to smack talk other frameworks and actually gained an appreciation for Angular. This was the course that I crashed through to ramp on the project and it was a great experience. This course takes you from start to finish on how to use the framework as well as all the tools that the CLI offers to make development that much faster. So If you want to get started in Angular this course if a home run.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bonus Ionic 4 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/ionic-2-the-practical-guide-to-building-ios-android-apps/" target="_blank">Bonus Ionic 4</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1070124_3a0f_3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2747"/></figure>



<p>For the project that I was referring to in the above article, we were also using ionic to develop. So Ionic 4 was on the roster for the ramp up and obviously, I went straight to Udemy. This course was an awesome find. After going through it myself I sent it to my coworkers and they also found it super helpful. He shows you all the capabilities of the framework and how to get your project showing up on your phone in no time. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Ionic, it&#8217;s a framework that turns your web development project into a native app. It originally was only for Angular but recently just released support for React and Vue. So if you want to turn to web development skills into native app development this course is a great option.</p>

<h2>Recommended Instructors</h2>



<p>My two favorite instructors on Udemy are Stephen Grider and Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. Both do an incredible job of explaining complex concepts in an understandable way, create interesting and useful projects that incorporate all the lessons taught and are easy to follow. If I haven&#8217;t recommended a course that is in your field of interest, I would recommend any of the courses they offer. Both have a vast collection of videos in a plethora of different programming languages.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope you find these suggestions helpful and if I&#8217;ve missed a great course please leave a comment with a link. I would love to hear your guy&#8217;s suggestions.</p>

<p></p>



<p>When I started to get into the coding world I immediately started looking for good places to learn online. I&#8217;ve never been a book kind of person and I think learning to code from books is a little &#8220;clunky&#8221; (Leave a comment at the bottom of your opinion). So I surfed around and found:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.codecademy.com/webpack/44e01805165bfde4e6e4322c540abf81.svg" alt="Codecademy logo"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Codecademy (opens in a new tab)">Codecademy</a></p>



<p>This is an amazing resource if you&#8217;re looking to get started in the programming world because it assumes you have no prior knowledge. It has an in-browser editor, step-by-step instructions and good explanations and hints for all the lessons. And best of all, its free! There is a pro version available that gives you access to more help. This site is how I got started in programming and its always my first recommendation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1467"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pluralsight (opens in a new tab)">Pluralsight</a></p>



<p>So after I had been working as a web developer&nbsp;for a year a software company asked if I would join their team as front-end lead. Not knowing anything about software developing I naturally took the job. And that&#8217;s when they recommended I use Pluralsight to get up to speed. It was a monthly membership fee of $15 and I could go through as many tutorials as I wanted and I did. The courses were thorough and clear about all the concepts, terms and syntax. I was able to get up to speed with the company in a matter of days!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1468"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Udemy (opens in a new tab)">Udemy</a></p>



<p>Now I saved this for last because it&#8217;s my favorite and I still use it. I can honestly save I have never learned so much from a website than I have from Udemy. The rating system and recommended courses they gave were exactly what I wanted and although you pay per course, the courses are hugely extensive, thorough, and easy to follow. Stephen Grider is a personal favorite instructor of mine. He really walked me through every step, not leaving any stone unturned. A lot of the courses have expectations that you have some knowledge of the subject but there are courses that will take you from the ground up. Udemy is my top recommendation for learning to code.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1469"/></figure>



<h2>BONUS: Youtube</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Learncode.academy (opens in a new tab)">Learncode.academy</a></p>



<p>There is a world of resources out there for learning to program. All you have to do is Google. Youtube is another place to learn and there are piles of channels dedicated to creating tutorials. Learncode.academy was a channel that I found myself frequently visiting for great tutorials and a range of coding subjects and frameworks.</p>
