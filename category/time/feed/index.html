<p>I love to longboard, record music, paint, craft, workout, code, design while running two businesses and still have a social life, so time management is something I had to figure out. These are my three tips for managing your time better.</p>



<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>



<h2>Focus</h2>



<p>Now I know this may seem a super general but give me a second to explain. There is a misconception that multitasking is the most effective way to get things done but that&#8217;s not the case. Your brain can only think about one thing at a time, the variable (how good at multitasking you are) is how fast your brain can flip between subjects. And it&#8217;s in these times of flipping back and forth when <g class="gr_ gr_117 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="117" data-gr-id="117">valuable</g> time is lost.</p>



<p>I had a great interview with Mitch from <a href="https://codingwithmitch.com/">CodingWithMitch</a>&nbsp;and the subject of time management came up. He had a great analogy about focus. He said</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Imagine you&#8217;re stacking Jenga blocks. You keep stacking them up higher and higher. Then someone comes along and smacks the whole tower down. And you start stacking the blocks back up again.</p></blockquote>



<p>The blocks are your thought process. When you are undisturbed and focusing on one subject (in this case code) you can stack your thought blocks very high. But when someone interrupts and you have to flip between subjects, you are forced to start stacking all over again.</p>



<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s not realistic to think that you could never go undisturbed once you start working but setting blocks of time to be intentionally focused on one project or problem can be hugely beneficial for your productivity.</p>



<h2>Removing Time Wasters</h2>



<p>All my life I&#8217;ve been told that I have too much time on my hands. This always irked me a little because we all the the same amount of time on our hands. We all have 24 hours in a day.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We all have the same amount of time on our hands. Do things that don&#8217;t waste it.</p></blockquote>



<p>But it got me to thinking about why people feel this way. What I found was that people (including myself) have things in there life that eat away at their time when they don&#8217;t notice, making them feel as though others have more time than they do.</p>



<p>The key is to remove these time wasters. For me it was watching endless Facebook videos. I found myself wasters hours just watching meaningless videos and feeling unsatisfied afterwards. I removed the Facebook app from my phone and found hours of my life back!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m not saying you have to cut Netflix and social apps from your life but being more mindful of things that are prone to waste your time can help you make your time more <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="3" data-gr-id="3">effective</g>. And this perfectly flows into my next and last tip.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Change Your Mentality</h2>



<p>Time management isn&#8217;t about finding more time to work it&#8217;s about finding a proper balance between working and resting. What I was finding was that time wasters were not helping me rest or work but merely distracting me from things that I really wanted to be doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how do determine if something is helping you rest or just waste your <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">time.</g>&nbsp;And this is where you need to change your mentality. The question to ask yourself is&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Does this add value to my life?</p></blockquote>



<p>I doesn&#8217;t have to be work but does this help me relax, or am I investing in a relationship or myself. The answer to that question will help you determine if that&#8217;s something you need/want or whether it&#8217;s just a distraction. Sometimes an episode of New Girl is a great way to unwind from a crazy day. </p>



<p>The key is to evaluate the ways you spend your time and in doing so you will see the areas where you are productive and the ways you waste your time. Change your mentality in this way and you&#8217;ll see that you&#8217;ll become more productive with your time in work and in relaxation.</p>
