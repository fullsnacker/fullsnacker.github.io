<p>Years ago when I first wanted to learn to program, I thought, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Well, the first thing I need is a code editor.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>So I googled to best code editor of the day. Through a bunch of searching I found an editor called Sublime and at that time it was. I always like to think that I started using it before it became mainstream (the hipster in me lol). </p>



<p>Having a design background, first things first- this needs to look prettier. And so, the search for the best theme began. To this day, although the editor itself may have changed, the desire to find a better, cooler theme still lives within me. As I&#8217;m sure it does in you as well.</p>



<p>Below are some of the best themes I&#8217;ve worked with. I&#8217;m a guy that likes to switch it up a lot but I&#8217;m always picking one of these themes. If I&#8217;ve missed one that you think should be on the list, please leave a comment with the name of it! I would love to check it out and maybe update this list.</p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Synth Wave &#8217;84</a></h2>



<p>I&#8217;m coming out the gate swinging. This is by far the coolest theme that I have ever used. Synth Wave &#8217;84 has awesome neon colors, wild gradients and the best of all is&#8230; the text flipping GLOWS! This theme would do the new season of Stranger Things incredible justice. </p>



<p>The setup of this theme is a touch more involved than most but believe me it&#8217;s worth it. You can <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">get install instructions here!</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Night Owl</a></h2>



<p>Night Owl was a random find when I was looking up how to make my own theme but was so good I stopped trying. This one has been my go to theme for the longest time probably because I love the idea of a theme design specifically for me, a Night Owl:)</p>



<p>Now I know, heaven forbid I use a light theme, but sometimes when I work outside, I have to. And the nice thing about the Night Owl theme is that it has a complimentary light theme in the same palette. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Check it out here!</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Material Theme</a></h2>



<p>This theme dates right back to the beginning for me. My absolute favorite theme for Sublime was a material theme. As I worked my way through different editors, the material theme is always one I looked for. So naturally, when I landed on Visual Studio Code, I immediately searched for Material Theme. For Me, Material Theme is the standard with a little nostalgia so I don&#8217;t know if it can ever come off my list.</p>



<p>Also, you can download the accompanying icon set which takes the theme to a new level! <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">See what you think.</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wonderpanda.arbiter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Arbiter</a></h2>



<p>Now, this is a particularly awesome theme because I work with the guy that made it! Now I&#8217;m pretty selective about what themes I use but Jesse (WonderPanda) nailed this one and we use it company wide! It&#8217;s easy on the eyes but still very visible. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wonderpanda.arbiter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">See for yourself!</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mariorodeghiero.vue-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Vue Theme</a></h2>



<p>Obviously, if you&#8217;re a fan of Vue you&#8217;re going to love this theme. I really enjoy the color choices as well as some line highlighting to show where braces open and close. Overall its a solid theme for when I&#8217;m looking to change things up. Maybe it&#8217;ll be your fav! <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mariorodeghiero.vue-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">You can see it here.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/example.png?fit=1024%2C489&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2529"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Slack Theme (Bonus Fun)</a></h2>



<p>Now I don&#8217;t know if I would seriously use this one but I thought it was hilarious when I first stumbled upon it; a Visual Studio Code theme that looks like Slack. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Check it out here</a> and let me know if you start using it full time. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve been hunting for good themes for years and the hunt for better will always continue but hopefully, this article has been helpful and that you were able to find a Visual Studio Code theme that fit your needs and pleased your eyes. I think these are the best VS Code themes of 2019 but if you think you have a better one, through it in the comments and I&#8217;ll check it out. One of these days I&#8217;ll have to make my own:)</p>
