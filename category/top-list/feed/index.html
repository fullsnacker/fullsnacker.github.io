<p>You want to learn to program but don&#8217;t know where to start. You want to level up your skills but you don&#8217;t have a mentor. You want to learn how to make an application with authentication. The list can go on and on and they all have the same answer; tutorials.</p>



<p>There are piles of free and paid tutorials out there which makes it hard to find the really good ones. I have gone through countless tutorials on multiple different sites but the one I keep going back to is Udemy.</p>



<p>Udemy has taught me so much and I attribute a huge amount of my success to all the awesome courses that they offer. You&#8217;ll notice that I prefer certain instructors and you can find them at the end of this article. I would recommend any of the courses they offer.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/javascript-advanced/" target="_blank">Advanced JavaScript</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12311" width="244" height="137" srcset="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1.jpg 480w, https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/670034_ce04_4-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></figure>



<p>There are a lot of free hello world tutorials out there for learning Javascript but after learning the basics I was looking for a way to level up. This course takes you through and explains the basics as well as advanced concepts in JavaScript. Understanding even the basics in a detailed way helped me understand how the language works on a deeper level. If you&#8217;re looking to level up your JS skills this course if for you.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Node with React (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/" target="_blank">Node with React</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1254420_f6cb_4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2742"/></figure>



<p>You guys know how much I love React. Well, this course was the beginning for me. I learned from start to finish, project structure, life cycle methods, processing payments, setting up a node server and all the rest. This is an incredibly thorough course that breaks down even the most complex concepts into understandable bites. If you want to learn React this is the one I would recommend the most. As a note, he uses a Mongo DB for the database which I recommend as well and I have a course for it further down.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="React Redux Firebase (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-firebase/" target="_blank">React Redux Firebase</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1532232_1cdc_8.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2743"/></figure>



<p>Working with Mongo is awesome but it does require a backend server so when I found out about Firebase and that its serverless I hoped on. And obviously, I&#8217;m going to use React as the frontend but state management can be a lot but Redux is so good for it. This course shows how to make them all work together and the flow has been one that I&#8217;ve used in multiple projects. If you&#8217;re looking to work with these frameworks, I would highly recommend this course.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/" target="_blank">Mongo DB</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1000574_06cb.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2745"/></figure>



<p>One of the first web development jobs was working on an application that used Mongo DB it holds a special place in my heart. And I have used other databases but I always come back to Mongo. This course shows you how to manage and utilize all the amazing capabilities that Mongo DB offers. He does a great job of explaining what he&#8217;s doing as he&#8217;s doing it and is really easy to follow. If you&#8217;re going to start using Mongo DB, this course is what you need.</p>

<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Angular 8 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/" target="_blank">Angular 8</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/756150_c033_2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2746"/></figure>



<p>Now you guys know I&#8217;m all about React but recently I had to learn Angular 8 for a project. Although I was reluctant, tools and tools and I&#8217;ve learned not to smack talk other frameworks and actually gained an appreciation for Angular. This was the course that I crashed through to ramp on the project and it was a great experience. This course takes you from start to finish on how to use the framework as well as all the tools that the CLI offers to make development that much faster. So If you want to get started in Angular this course if a home run.</p>



<h2><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bonus Ionic 4 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.udemy.com/ionic-2-the-practical-guide-to-building-ios-android-apps/" target="_blank">Bonus Ionic 4</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1070124_3a0f_3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2747"/></figure>



<p>For the project that I was referring to in the above article, we were also using ionic to develop. So Ionic 4 was on the roster for the ramp up and obviously, I went straight to Udemy. This course was an awesome find. After going through it myself I sent it to my coworkers and they also found it super helpful. He shows you all the capabilities of the framework and how to get your project showing up on your phone in no time. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Ionic, it&#8217;s a framework that turns your web development project into a native app. It originally was only for Angular but recently just released support for React and Vue. So if you want to turn to web development skills into native app development this course is a great option.</p>

<h2>Recommended Instructors</h2>



<p>My two favorite instructors on Udemy are Stephen Grider and Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. Both do an incredible job of explaining complex concepts in an understandable way, create interesting and useful projects that incorporate all the lessons taught and are easy to follow. If I haven&#8217;t recommended a course that is in your field of interest, I would recommend any of the courses they offer. Both have a vast collection of videos in a plethora of different programming languages.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope you find these suggestions helpful and if I&#8217;ve missed a great course please leave a comment with a link. I would love to hear your guy&#8217;s suggestions.</p>

<p>Years ago when I first wanted to learn to program, I thought, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Well, the first thing I need is a code editor.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>So I googled to best code editor of the day. Through a bunch of searching I found an editor called Sublime and at that time it was. I always like to think that I started using it before it became mainstream (the hipster in me lol). </p>



<p>Having a design background, first things first- this needs to look prettier. And so, the search for the best theme began. To this day, although the editor itself may have changed, the desire to find a better, cooler theme still lives within me. As I&#8217;m sure it does in you as well.</p>



<p>Below are some of the best themes I&#8217;ve worked with. I&#8217;m a guy that likes to switch it up a lot but I&#8217;m always picking one of these themes. If I&#8217;ve missed one that you think should be on the list, please leave a comment with the name of it! I would love to check it out and maybe update this list.</p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Synth Wave &#8217;84</a></h2>



<p>I&#8217;m coming out the gate swinging. This is by far the coolest theme that I have ever used. Synth Wave &#8217;84 has awesome neon colors, wild gradients and the best of all is&#8230; the text flipping GLOWS! This theme would do the new season of Stranger Things incredible justice. </p>



<p>The setup of this theme is a touch more involved than most but believe me it&#8217;s worth it. You can <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">get install instructions here!</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/theme.jpg?fit=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2521"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Night Owl</a></h2>



<p>Night Owl was a random find when I was looking up how to make my own theme but was so good I stopped trying. This one has been my go to theme for the longest time probably because I love the idea of a theme design specifically for me, a Night Owl:)</p>



<p>Now I know, heaven forbid I use a light theme, but sometimes when I work outside, I have to. And the nice thing about the Night Owl theme is that it has a complimentary light theme in the same palette. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Check it out here!</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Material Theme</a></h2>



<p>This theme dates right back to the beginning for me. My absolute favorite theme for Sublime was a material theme. As I worked my way through different editors, the material theme is always one I looked for. So naturally, when I landed on Visual Studio Code, I immediately searched for Material Theme. For Me, Material Theme is the standard with a little nostalgia so I don&#8217;t know if it can ever come off my list.</p>



<p>Also, you can download the accompanying icon set which takes the theme to a new level! <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">See what you think.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-7.43.45-AM.png?fit=1024%2C625&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2526"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wonderpanda.arbiter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Arbiter</a></h2>



<p>Now, this is a particularly awesome theme because I work with the guy that made it! Now I&#8217;m pretty selective about what themes I use but Jesse (WonderPanda) nailed this one and we use it company wide! It&#8217;s easy on the eyes but still very visible. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wonderpanda.arbiter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">See for yourself!</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-7.54.10-AM.png?fit=1024%2C625&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2527"/></figure>

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mariorodeghiero.vue-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Vue Theme</a></h2>



<p>Obviously, if you&#8217;re a fan of Vue you&#8217;re going to love this theme. I really enjoy the color choices as well as some line highlighting to show where braces open and close. Overall its a solid theme for when I&#8217;m looking to change things up. Maybe it&#8217;ll be your fav! <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mariorodeghiero.vue-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">You can see it here.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/example.png?fit=1024%2C489&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2529"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Slack Theme (Bonus Fun)</a></h2>



<p>Now I don&#8217;t know if I would seriously use this one but I thought it was hilarious when I first stumbled upon it; a Visual Studio Code theme that looks like Slack. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Check it out here</a> and let me know if you start using it full time. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve been hunting for good themes for years and the hunt for better will always continue but hopefully, this article has been helpful and that you were able to find a Visual Studio Code theme that fit your needs and pleased your eyes. I think these are the best VS Code themes of 2019 but if you think you have a better one, through it in the comments and I&#8217;ll check it out. One of these days I&#8217;ll have to make my own:)</p>
