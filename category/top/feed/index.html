<p></p>



<p>As all web developers do, I have a set of tools I use on every web development project.&nbsp; So I thought I would share mine with you. These are tools that I can say with all honesty have greatly increased my efficiency. I should mention that I work primarily with Apple products so some of these tools may not be available for PC users. However, there are <g class="gr_ gr_591 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="591" data-gr-id="591">equilvalents</g>&nbsp;out there.</p>



<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/images.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1488"/></a></figure>



<p>Obviously a code editor is an essential for any programming development stack but I tried a lot of the popular code editors and VS Code is my favourite by far. I started out on Sublime Text and used it all through college and the first two years of my web development career. Then I switch companies and they used WebStorm. I liked it a lot but it wasn&#8217;t free so when I left that company I started trying other editors. I used atom for a while but found it to be a little slow and clunky. Then there was a large movement to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> so I thought I&#8217;d see what all the fuss was about. And after using it for a week I knew why. The speed, the plugins and the built in terminal are just a couple of my favourite features. It&#8217;s now an essential tool in my development belt.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sass&nbsp;(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2000px-Sass_Logo_Color.svg-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1489" width="275" height="206"/></a></figure>



<p>Now as a web developer I spent a lot of time writing CSS. When I was at <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">an FITC</g> (Future Innovations Technology Conference) in Toronto quite a few years ago I went to a talk on <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Now as a web developer I spent a lot of time writing CSS. When I was at an FITC (Future Innovations Technology Conference) in Toronto quite a few years ago I went to a talk on Sass and it changed my development stack forever. I'm not going to go into huge detail about all its features but the site says (opens in a new tab)">Sass</a> and it changed my development stack forever. I&#8217;m not going to go into huge detail about all its features but the site says</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the&nbsp;world.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds incredible functionality. Sass is compiled through a tool called Compass into CSS. The amount of time writing in Sass has saved me is incalculable.</p>



<p>There are other CSS preprocessors like LESS or Stylus but Sass is mine and most people&#8217;s choice.</p>



<h2>Bourbon Neat</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/neat-logo-v2-icon.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1490"/></a></figure>



<p>After integrating Sass into my development stack the question of what grid system should I use arose. I had been playing around with a few other grid systems but when I started tinkering with Neat I immediately knew this was the one. <a href="https://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="After integrating Sass into my development stack the question of what grid system should I use arose. I had been playing around with a few other grid systems but when I started tinkering with Neat I immediately knew this was the one. Bourbon Neat is&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)">Bourbon Neat</a> is&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A lightweight and flexible Sass&nbsp;grid</p></blockquote>



<p>Its simple and doesn&#8217;t use any flex-box (flex-box wasn&#8217;t always stable) but still has incredible&nbsp;customization so it fits every project I build. It uses Sass mixins to set column widths and offsets so I never need to add loads of classes to my HTML.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thoughtbot is the development team that created Neat and they also have some other great tools to checkout like Bourbon and Bitters (there&#8217;s a theme, yes).</p>



<h2>Codekit</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://codekitapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/download-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1492" width="191" height="191"/></a></figure>



<p>This is the ultimate tool! <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is the ultimate tool! Codekit's main purpose is to compile and compress languages down for faster, better development but it does so much more than that. Its browser refresh feature is one of my favorites. I make a change in my code and it automatically recompiles and refreshes my browser. I know that's not revolutionary but it makes it so simple to get back into a project. Just drag your project in and within a couple clicks,&nbsp;you are setup with Sass, Compass, Bourbon Neat etc.&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)" href="https://codekitapp.com/" target="_blank">Codekit</a>&#8216;s main purpose is to compile and compress languages down for faster, better development but it does so much more than that.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Another great feature is that it can take multiple Sass or Javascript files and compile them into one compressed file. A great way to increase load times for your website.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<h2>MAMP</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mamp-pro.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1493" width="179" height="179"/></a></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MAMP is the final piece of the puzzle. According to the website (opens in a new tab)">MAMP</a> is the final piece of the puzzle. According to the website</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>MAMP is a&nbsp;<strong>free, local server</strong>&nbsp;environment that can be installed under&nbsp;<strong>macOS</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;with just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>MAMP turns your computer into a local server so that you can run and test PHP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of my clients want to run the content for their websites so natural I use WordPress as the CMS (content management system). This means that I need to be able to develop in PHP and run MySQL databases. And that&#8217;s exactly way MAMP allows me to do.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Now MAMP does have a paid version but I have never felt the need to pay for it when the free version does exactly what I need.

<p>MAMP is a mac product but I know there are PC tools that do the same, such as LAMP.</p>



<p>Those are my top 5 essential web development tools. If you have other tools that you use on every project I would love to hear about them. Always down to add or replace tools with better ones. Let&#8217;s keep making our code DRYer and our development time shorter!</p>

<p></p>



<p>When I started to get into the coding world I immediately started looking for good places to learn online. I&#8217;ve never been a book kind of person and I think learning to code from books is a little &#8220;clunky&#8221; (Leave a comment at the bottom of your opinion). So I surfed around and found:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.codecademy.com/webpack/44e01805165bfde4e6e4322c540abf81.svg" alt="Codecademy logo"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Codecademy (opens in a new tab)">Codecademy</a></p>



<p>This is an amazing resource if you&#8217;re looking to get started in the programming world because it assumes you have no prior knowledge. It has an in-browser editor, step-by-step instructions and good explanations and hints for all the lessons. And best of all, its free! There is a pro version available that gives you access to more help. This site is how I got started in programming and its always my first recommendation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1467"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pluralsight (opens in a new tab)">Pluralsight</a></p>



<p>So after I had been working as a web developer&nbsp;for a year a software company asked if I would join their team as front-end lead. Not knowing anything about software developing I naturally took the job. And that&#8217;s when they recommended I use Pluralsight to get up to speed. It was a monthly membership fee of $15 and I could go through as many tutorials as I wanted and I did. The courses were thorough and clear about all the concepts, terms and syntax. I was able to get up to speed with the company in a matter of days!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1468"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Udemy (opens in a new tab)">Udemy</a></p>



<p>Now I saved this for last because it&#8217;s my favorite and I still use it. I can honestly save I have never learned so much from a website than I have from Udemy. The rating system and recommended courses they gave were exactly what I wanted and although you pay per course, the courses are hugely extensive, thorough, and easy to follow. Stephen Grider is a personal favorite instructor of mine. He really walked me through every step, not leaving any stone unturned. A lot of the courses have expectations that you have some knowledge of the subject but there are courses that will take you from the ground up. Udemy is my top recommendation for learning to code.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1469"/></figure>



<h2>BONUS: Youtube</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Learncode.academy (opens in a new tab)">Learncode.academy</a></p>



<p>There is a world of resources out there for learning to program. All you have to do is Google. Youtube is another place to learn and there are piles of channels dedicated to creating tutorials. Learncode.academy was a channel that I found myself frequently visiting for great tutorials and a range of coding subjects and frameworks.</p>

<h2>Computer</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07FMLZCR5/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07FMLZCR5&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=e48a26007a280555e9d814d51af2ef21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B07FMLZCR5&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Obviously to have a computer setup you need to have a computer to start with. And I use a laptop so that&#8217;s really all I &#8220;need&#8221; but if I&#8217;m being honest to work comfortably I need more. So I started my setup with a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Obviously to have a computer setup you need to have a computer to start with.

I was able to get one with a touch bar. People ask whether I like the touch bar or not and honestly, its not a big deal to me. I like it and some of the features are cool but not revolutionary to my work flow.

<h2>Monitors</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F9UBSV0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B01F9UBSV0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=6a75692ccb10689bcc811d7cf47d9316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B01F9UBSV0&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>I could just work off a laptop but I need more screen space than 15 inches. So I got 2 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="I could just work off a laptop but I need more screen space than 15 inches. So I got 2 Samsung 27&quot; LED monitors.

They aren&#8217;t 4k which I kind of wish they were but when I&#8217;m just writing code I don&#8217;t need the ultra high definition. In the future I&#8217;d love to upgrade.</p>



<h2>Monitor Stand</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07B6F1MYY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=6685fb3907ff74c216e86b16a7686e42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>So I had both monitors just sitting on my desk and the stands they were on took up half of it so I immediately head to Amazon for a solution. Right away I found Vivo and their incredible line of products. I purchased my <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07B6F1MYY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=5b41d62f36f7bf48bd3fa3a10211bf13">Vivo dual monitor mount</a> and could not be more pleased with a product. I got so much desk space back and actually helped with my posture because I was able to raise the screen to a better height. Truly a king-pin of my setup.</p>



<h2>HDMI to USB-C</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07CGCQTQ3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07CGCQTQ3&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=e7fa3b39dba5b0de37eb4f146e30dece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B07CGCQTQ3&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>I get asked a lot how I am able to have dual monitors with a MacBook Pro and the answer is super simple, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01LYS3Q5A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01LYS3Q5A&amp;linkId=46f8bf55424058d9b04edd7839ac8866">HDMI to USBC cable</a>. I just plug the HDMI end into the monitor and the USBC end into my Mac and it works. I go into Settings &gt; Display and adjust the layout and we&#8217;re rolling.</p>



<h2>Keyboard</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B071J5WTT6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=e295dcbe1b7306c1ca1ad83a3eb0c3b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Another cornerstone of my setup is my keyboard because as we all know, a programmers number one tool is their keyboard. I had been using a <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="8" data-gr-id="8">Razor</g> Black Widow Tournament Edition for quite some time and really enjoyed it. Then I moved to an X-bow Ergonomic Keyboard for a couple months until I switched to what I use now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071J5WTT6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackdeve-20&amp;linkId=6c1973b6afcf988e8807951efbd7d6ca">Vortex Race 3</a>. I got it with silent red switches because I love reds but I also work in a co-working office (so a loud keyboard isn&#8217;t very welcome). I can honestly say this is my keyboard for life. I know many other programmers as well that swear by it.</p>



<h2>Key Caps</h2>



<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076Q1DC4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B076Q1DC4Q&amp;linkId=541f3fe2f9a514c36d074684db65f5ec"><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/715SFoTOruL._SL1500_-1-e1544636707299-1024x616.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1457" width="376" height="225"></figure></a>



<p>But obviously, I can just leave something with the stock setup. Even though the original keycaps are amazing I had to customize. So being the very extra person I am, I got <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076Q1DC4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B076Q1DC4Q&amp;linkId=4caf469bbaa4576135c6ca0a50fadd02">golden keycaps</a> to really &#8220;pimp out&#8221; my keyboard. Being extra is a necessity for me.</p>



<h2>Mouse</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B016QO5YNG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=3734e50ff42065e9832aa81a2e34b33c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Most programmers that pride in the fact that they don&#8217;t need to use a mouse at all but as I also do a lot of graphic design, its used an equal amount. I&#8217;ve had my <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B016QO5YNG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;linkId=496b15d4a1943248995fbc8786935ae5">magic mouse</a> for over 9 years and it works flawlessly which I think is a huge testament to the quality of the product. Having the touch features and being able to swipe through multiple desktops has been <strong>so</strong> essential to my workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrist Pads</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004D8PYE2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=79c76c09c0abae56def6ad82d311d136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Keeping my setup ergonomic is key because I spend full days at my desk. I have struggled in the past with shoulder numbness and carpal tunnel so having proper wrist support is a must. I use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004D8PYE2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;linkId=d70af354626804d7c981f036b41027ce">Grifiti Fat Wrist Pads</a> for my mouse and keyboard and I haven&#8217;t had any pain.</p>



<h2>Headphones</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MQWUXZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=3b58c47897e335f1aa0e9e231ff25aae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>As all good programmers do, I need quiet, undistracted focused to be able to code to the best of my abilities. But as I mentioned before, I work in a co-working space, so silence is rare.&nbsp; The solution: headphones. And there is no better solution that <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MQWUXZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;linkId=9ea10abf0b2a37541ae61981e8bf3b82">AirPods</a>. I was a skeptic of them at first but my friends kept raving about them so I took a chance and got some. I was not disappointed. They rarely leave my ears. I can wear them for a full day and my ears don&#8217;t get sore at all (which is usually a problem for me).&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Standing Mat</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00V3TO9EK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B00V3TO9EK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=a93d3814d491db5282b0cf7827f8af68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B00V3TO9EK&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The final piece to my setup is my standing mat. I have a sit-to-stand desk which has been incredible for productivity and mood but having high-arched feet, they get fatigued quickly. The <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00V3TO9EK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00V3TO9EK&amp;linkId=b78ed44597cf6a0d8737814dbfc4771b"><g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">ErgoDriven</g> Standing Mat</a> has an amazing design to help counter standing fatigue and improve posture. I am able to move around on it and even massage my feet while I work. An essential piece to my computer setup.</p>



<p>If you guys have more questions about my setup or thoughts on any of these products I&#8217;d love to hear about them in the comments. My setup is constantly changing so I&#8217;ll keep you updated when I switch things up.</p>
