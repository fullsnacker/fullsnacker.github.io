								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everybody loves more screen space, especially programmers. And in today’s work environment most development teams and coders work off laptops (usually Macs). So the real struggle is finding more of it. As soon as I sit down, I immediately look for an external monitor to plug into. If possible to connect to two monitors, then I am really in luck. But the white whale of laptop setups is connecting three monitors to one laptop. Today, I’m going to share how I did it!</p>



<h2>Computer</h2>



<p>First things first, your computer has got to be able to handle the number of pixels it&#8217;s going to be pushing. I’m letting you know right off the hop, a 13” MacBook Pro cannot handle three displays regardless of the resolution. Two is the max, but you can keep the laptop open so it like 2.5 monitors.</p>



<p>I got my triple monitor setup working with my 15”, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB memory, Radeon Pro 450 2 GB Intel HD Graphics 530 1536 MB, MacBook Pro. If you would like to know everything I use in my setup, check out my article on it at <a href="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/">https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/2018/12/12/10-essentials-for-my-computer-setup/</a>. <br></p>

<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>



<h2>Dongle</h2>



<p>One of the most important things about making the triple monitor setup work is the dongle. Now I’m going to save my rant on the dongle life for another time but you need to choose the right dongle. I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KafG3b">iHaper USB-C hub</a> because it’s the one I use and its worked great. If you go with another dongle/hub, make sure that it has at least one HDMI port (for monitor), one USB-C port (for power), and one standard USB port (for keyboard). </p>



<h2>Cables</h2>



<p>This is one that I think a lot of people don’t think of when they’re getting their setup wired. Since the MacBook Pro’s only have USB-C inputs you either have to use a converter to connect your HDMI monitor or, and this is the one I use, you buy <a href="https://amzn.to/2XlNReJ">HDMI to USB-C cables</a>. You will also need just a regular HDMI cable as well that will plug into the dongle.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6160549320"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>



<h2>Monitors</h2>



<p>Three monitors is the max that a 15” MacBook Pro can handle but only one can be 4k. The others need to be 1080p. You can, however, have the laptop open as another display. 13” MacBooks can only handle two external displays and they cannot be 4k. If you’re more interested in quality then, you can connect two 4k monitors to your 15” MacBook.</p>



<h2>Laptop Stand</h2>



<p>This is not necessary but if you’re like me and like to keep the desk clutter to a minimum, it&#8217;s a huge help. I use the<a href="https://amzn.to/2WImCX2"> Arc upright laptop stand</a>. It keeps the cable chaos under control as well as looking pretty cool.</p>



<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8142024765890977" data-ad-slot="6616654362"></ins>



<h2>Connecting</h2>



<ol><li>The laptop must be on or sleeping (must not be shutdown)</li><li>Plug the regular HDMI cable into dongle and monitor</li><li>Plug power cable into dongle and power source (When multiple displays are plugged in, the laptop must be plugged in to operate)</li><li>Plug keyboard into the dongle (optional if you plan on using the laptop as a display)</li><li>Connect HDMI-to-USB-C cables to monitors.</li><li>Plug the dongle into one side of the laptop</li><li>Connect the other two HDMI-to-USB-C cables to the laptop</li><li>Click mouse or type on the keyboard to wake up the laptop</li><li>Monitors should now all be displaying</li></ol>



<h2>Settings</h2>



<p>To change the arrangement of the screens, go to System Preferences &gt; Displays &gt; Arrangement. You can now click and drag around how you would like your setup. A red border will signify the display that you are moving. You can also change the resolutions and other settings here to customize your setup.</p>

<p>Obviously to have a computer setup you need to have a computer to start with.

<h2>Monitors</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F9UBSV0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B01F9UBSV0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=6a75692ccb10689bcc811d7cf47d9316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B01F9UBSV0&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>I could just work off a laptop but I need more screen space than 15 inches. So I got 2 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="I could just work off a laptop but I need more screen space than 15 inches. So I got 2 Samsung 27&quot; LED monitors. Now, the 27-inch model is no longer available in the US but you can get the 23.5-inch model. They aren't 4k which I kind of wish they were (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F9UBSV0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01F9UBSV0&amp;linkId=4ef3d9d403717a32cb0b5cab90dd36f5" target="_blank">Samsung 27&#8243; LED monitors</a>. They aren&#8217;t 4k which I kind of wish they were but when I&#8217;m just writing code I don&#8217;t need the ultra high definition. In the future I&#8217;d love to upgrade.</p>



<h2>Monitor Stand</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07B6F1MYY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=6685fb3907ff74c216e86b16a7686e42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>So I had both monitors just sitting on my desk and the stands they were on took up half of it so I immediately head to Amazon for a solution. Right away I found Vivo and their incredible line of products. I purchased my <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07B6F1MYY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07B6F1MYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=5b41d62f36f7bf48bd3fa3a10211bf13">Vivo dual monitor mount</a> and could not be more pleased with a product. I got so much desk space back and actually helped with my posture because I was able to raise the screen to a better height. Truly a king-pin of my setup.</p>



<h2>HDMI to USB-C</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07CGCQTQ3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B07CGCQTQ3&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=e7fa3b39dba5b0de37eb4f146e30dece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B07CGCQTQ3&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>I get asked a lot how I am able to have dual monitors with a MacBook Pro and the answer is super simple, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01LYS3Q5A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01LYS3Q5A&amp;linkId=46f8bf55424058d9b04edd7839ac8866">HDMI to USBC cable</a>. I just plug the HDMI end into the monitor and the USBC end into my Mac and it works. I go into Settings &gt; Display and adjust the layout and we&#8217;re rolling.</p>



<h2>Keyboard</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B071J5WTT6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=e295dcbe1b7306c1ca1ad83a3eb0c3b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Another cornerstone of my setup is my keyboard because as we all know, a programmers number one tool is their keyboard. I had been using a <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="8" data-gr-id="8">Razor</g> Black Widow Tournament Edition for quite some time and really enjoyed it. Then I moved to an X-bow Ergonomic Keyboard for a couple months until I switched to what I use now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071J5WTT6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B071J5WTT6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackdeve-20&amp;linkId=6c1973b6afcf988e8807951efbd7d6ca">Vortex Race 3</a>. I got it with silent red switches because I love reds but I also work in a co-working office (so a loud keyboard isn&#8217;t very welcome). I can honestly say this is my keyboard for life. I know many other programmers as well that swear by it.</p>



<h2>Key Caps</h2>



<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076Q1DC4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B076Q1DC4Q&amp;linkId=541f3fe2f9a514c36d074684db65f5ec"><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/715SFoTOruL._SL1500_-1-e1544636707299-1024x616.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1457" width="376" height="225"></figure></a>



<p>But obviously, I can just leave something with the stock setup. Even though the original keycaps are amazing I had to customize. So being the very extra person I am, I got <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076Q1DC4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B076Q1DC4Q&amp;linkId=4caf469bbaa4576135c6ca0a50fadd02">golden keycaps</a> to really &#8220;pimp out&#8221; my keyboard. Being extra is a necessity for me.</p>



<h2>Mouse</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B016QO5YNG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=3734e50ff42065e9832aa81a2e34b33c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Most programmers that pride in the fact that they don&#8217;t need to use a mouse at all but as I also do a lot of graphic design, its used an equal amount. I&#8217;ve had my <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B016QO5YNG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO5YNG&amp;linkId=496b15d4a1943248995fbc8786935ae5">magic mouse</a> for over 9 years and it works flawlessly which I think is a huge testament to the quality of the product. Having the touch features and being able to swipe through multiple desktops has been <strong>so</strong> essential to my workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrist Pads</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004D8PYE2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=79c76c09c0abae56def6ad82d311d136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Keeping my setup ergonomic is key because I spend full days at my desk. I have struggled in the past with shoulder numbness and carpal tunnel so having proper wrist support is a must. I use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004D8PYE2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004D8PYE2&amp;linkId=d70af354626804d7c981f036b41027ce">Grifiti Fat Wrist Pads</a> for my mouse and keyboard and I haven&#8217;t had any pain.</p>



<h2>Headphones</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MQWUXZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;linkId=3b58c47897e335f1aa0e9e231ff25aae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>As all good programmers do, I need quiet, undistracted focused to be able to code to the best of my abilities. But as I mentioned before, I work in a co-working space, so silence is rare.&nbsp; The solution: headphones. And there is no better solution that <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MQWUXZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullsnackde02-20&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01MQWUXZS&amp;linkId=9ea10abf0b2a37541ae61981e8bf3b82">AirPods</a>. I was a skeptic of them at first but my friends kept raving about them so I took a chance and got some. I was not disappointed. They rarely leave my ears. I can wear them for a full day and my ears don&#8217;t get sore at all (which is usually a problem for me).&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Standing Mat</h2>
