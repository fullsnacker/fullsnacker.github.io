I've loved game development ever since I started programming. I ultimately found my career path in web development but I still really enjoy creating phone games. A couple made it to the app store but a many didn't (I didn't keep up with Apple's app license so none are live now). So I thought I'd show the demos of all the games in the video above. All games were developed in ActionScript 3 and then compiled to iOS or Android through a tool called Air. All assets and development were done by yours truly.]]></description>

<p>I&#8217;ve loved game development ever since I started programming. I ultimately found my career path in web development but I still really enjoy creating phone games. A couple made it to the app store but a many didn&#8217;t (I didn&#8217;t keep up with Apple&#8217;s app license so none are live now). So I thought I&#8217;d show the demos of all the games in the video above. All games were developed in ActionScript 3 and then compiled to iOS or Android through a tool called Air.

<h2>Tiny Planet</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Tiny Planet Intro - Mobile Game" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmoiiutVwj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Tiny Planet with a game I created as a final project when I was in college for interactive media development. The video above is the intro to the game. I created all the assets in 3D Studio Max and then exported them out as images and made sprites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective of the game is to keep the missiles from striking earth by blocking them with a barge type spaceship for as long as you can. Tapping on the right and left of the screen propels the ship with momentum around the earth. There are also power ups that help you survive longer. The glowing ball-type objects are force fields that will protect from a single missile hit. The boxes are EMPs. When you swipe up (on mobile) or click one in the corner, a pulse goes destroying all missiles on the screen.</p>



<p>This was one of my <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">favourite</g> games to develop because it used a bunch of different fields like, 3D animation, graphic design, programming etc.</p>



<h2>Beaver Boy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-9.24.19-AM-1024x678.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1522"/></figure>



<p>The most Canadian game possible. You are a beaver wearing a toque that drinks maple syrup for energy to chew through trees. The power up is when you grab a maple leaf you get a birch canoe and paddle very fast with a hockey stick. It&#8217;s also always snowing. The only thing I missed was saying sorry when you lose and having a polar bear in there (maybe in Beaver Boy 2 lol).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a Canadian I thought it would be funny to make a game that played to all the stereotypes. You tap as fast as you can to chew through the oncoming trees that will push you back and out of frame. As you chew your energy syrup goes down so you need to jump up and grab some more. Every so often you can grab a maple leaf which will make you invincible for 10 seconds. The point of the game is to chew through as many trees as possible.</p>



<h2>Toaster Boy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.34.22-PM-736x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1533" width="329" height="457"/></figure>



<p>This one has the exact same favour as Flappy Bird, incredible frustrating but very addictive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is simple. Pop the toast out of the toaster and try to tap right when he enters the toaster again to bounce him out. Bounce him as many times as you can. The more you bounce him the higher he will go until he floats out into space. But believe me if you could get him into space you are not human.</p>



<p>This was fast little game that I would eventually love to get on the store. It was super fun to make and play.</p>

<h2>Robo-Gorilla</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="FullComp 1" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7iBfxzo9aSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This game was another final project for school. I designed all the piece of Robo-Gorilla in Adobe illustrator and then used a tool called Dragon Bones to animate him in the games.</p>



<p>I created a short animation in after effects to tell the story of Robo-Gorilla. Captured in the jungle and taken back to a lab, scientists weaponized him with guns and armour. Enraged when he woke up, Robo-Gorilla goes on a rampage to try and escape the facility.</p>



<p>There was a lot more I wanted to add to the game like different characters and power-ups but it was still a fun prototype.</p>



<h2>Jungle Jim</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.27.55-PM-1024x641.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1525"/></figure>



<p>I made this game on my reading week. Every single frame was hand drawn and coloured (time consuming) but I liked the effect.</p>



<p>The point of the game is to eat as many flies as you can but beware of snakes in the tree that will eat you. You can avoid the snakes by either going invisible or swiping down (on mobile) and going to the under side of the tree. I spent most of my time on the drawings so those features never go ironed out. Creating those animations was really fun though.</p>



<h2>Jack Astro</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.32.31-PM-746x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1531" width="302" height="414"/></figure>



<p>This game was a partnership between my brother and I. I was down visiting him in Toronto during my reading week and we created this game, a squirrel flying through space collecting acorns, avoiding asteroids and blasting through everything will a NOS jet pack. Sounds about as nutty as my brother and I are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We created the assets together and I developed it. The point of the game was to survive as long as possible without getting hit by an asteroid. You would collect acorns which you could then use to buy better handle on your jet pack or more NOS slots.</p>



<p>I still think this game has great potential and it is for sure one of my personal favorites.</p>



<h2>The Mail Room</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://fullsnackdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-18-at-12.29.46-PM-1-722x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1529" width="333" height="471"/></figure>



<p>This was a quick little game I made over a weekend. Different coloured letters fall from a shoot and you have to tap to rotate the funnel with the correct colour to catch the letter, a kind of sorting reaction-type game. Every so often a parcel falls and you have to swipe it out of the way (on mobile).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The graphics were fun to design and I enjoyed getting a quick hit of game development out.</p>



<p>Well those are some of the games that I&#8217;ve developed that didn&#8217;t make it to the app store. I have more but I&#8217;ll show those to you all a different time. Hope you enjoyed and let me know what your favourite game in the comments.</p>
