<p class="">SIGIL has been out for a while now. I uploaded the free version on May 31, 2019. Many YouTube playthrough videos have been uploaded and the response has been good. I had a great team of DOOM technicians helping me make sure all the data was as good as possible. Even though DOOM is 25 years old, every single line segment in a level has a bunch of information on it. Most levels have hundreds if not thousands of line segments in them, so it’s a lot of tech checking.</p><p class="">The awesome team includes dew (Boris Klimes), flambeau, UberGewei, and Keyboard_Doomer – they put up with my work start at about midnight most nights. We have a great Slack channel where we discuss all the tech stuff happening with the latest fixes. SIGIL is up to v1.21 now and it might not see another revision. It’s pretty good now. I toned down the crushers on E5M4, so maybe no more whining. :)</p><p class="">Anyway, the SIGIL experience was really good and I’m excited about what might be next….</p><p class="">If you want to download SIGIL, you can get it here for free:</p>

<p class="">Also, you might not know this, but we are selling some SIGIL merchandise on the Romero Games site. Check out the evil items here: </p>

<p>I just wanted to update you on SIGIL. There were a few snags in production trying to make sure everything is top-notch for fans!&nbsp; I just wanted to let everyone who purchased either the Big Box or the Beast Box know that it is now looking like it will ship sometime in April. Thank you for your patience, and I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. This also means the free version of SIGIL will have to wait until after the boxes are in the hands of customers.</p><p>EDIT: If you email info@romerogames.com and tell us that you missed the SIGIL box ordering window we will enter you in the list of people who want to order. We cannot guarantee that we can help get you a box, and it will most likely be more expensive than it was during the ordering window.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Reflections on DOOM's Development</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2018 10:23:10 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2018/12/10/reflections-on-dooms-development</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5c0e3e6570a6ad7e8a4ad1e3</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>The year of 1993 was a magical one, more so than any other. It was the only time we challenged ourselves as a group to create a game that was as good as anything we could have imagined at the time. We didn’t challenge ourselves like that before DOOM, nor after it. It was the right time to shoot for the stars.</p><p>Incredibly, and perhaps a bit naively, we made a list of the technological wizardry we planned to create, and boldly stated in a press release in January 1993, that DOOM would be a major source of productivity loss around the world. We truly believed it, and worked hard that year to make it happen. I don’t recommend writing a press release at the start of your project, especially one like that.</p><p>We did so many new things while creating DOOM. It was our first 3D game to use an engine that broke away from the 2D paradigm we were in from the start of the company, and even stayed in with Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny, at least for the map layouts. We wanted to use a video camera to scan in our weapons and monsters because we were using real workstations this time around – the mighty NeXTSTEP computers and operating system of Steve Jobs.</p><p>Making DOOM was difficult. We were creating a darker-themed game with our creative director Tom Hall who is an absolutely positive guy, and it was anathema to his design ethos. He laid the initial design groundwork by creating the DOOM Bible which outlined several design concepts we never implemented, some of which were included in 2016’s reboot.</p><p>The engine was revolutionary in that it represented a type of world that no one had seen on a computer screen before. Angled walls and halls that darken in the distance. A high-framerate nightmare some would call it, but it was a high octane blastfest that opened everyone’s eyes to the potential of the PC’s gaming future. Today’s first-person shooters trace their lineage back to this game that bears the distilled essence of what a shooter should be: balanced weapons, insidious level design, a complementary enemy menagerie, and lots of fast action.</p><p>Throughout the year we tweaked, and added, and removed elements of the game to make it just right. Gone were the score and lives, remnants of the arcades we grew up in. The items that supported a score were removed. The game was far better for it, and those choices influenced our future designs.</p><p>The application of Bruce Naylor’s binary space partition was a huge advance for 3D rendering speed, and the abstract level design style broke games out of the 90-degree maze wall design rut they had been in for 20 years. This was something new, with textured floors and ceilings, stairs, platforms, doors, and blinking lights. We loved having this design palette to work with, and it fit well with the subject matter we based the game upon: Hell.</p><p>As a group, we played Dungeons &amp; Dragons for years. Our main campaign was destroyed by demons teleporting onto the material plane and destroying everything in it. This gave us the idea of a demonic invasion, but we decided to base it in the future where we could have some really powerful weapons. Besides, the combination of Hell and science fiction was too great to ignore. We felt even the storyline was slightly new because of it.</p><p>Writing the DoomEd map editor to create levels was a dream. I was finally using a real operating system with an incredible programming language, Objective-C, and getting to program in a way I had never known. The fact that we had monitors at 1024x768 let us see our game in a way we couldn’t under DOS. Using these tools of the future helped us immensely.</p><p>There was so much we did that was new, it was a little mind-boggling. We were using high-end workstations, a brand-new 3D engine that allowed for incredible graphics and design expression, graphical scanning of our game sprites, and for the first time we were putting multiplayer into our game with a mode I called Deathmatch because that name just made sense.</p><p>The inclusion of multiplayer co-op and deathmatch modes changed everything about games. We knew that playing a game as fast and over-the-top as DOOM would signal a new era. I visualized what E1M7 would look like with two players shooting rockets at each other over a large room and it got me more excited than I had been since Wolfenstein 3D’s chaingun audio.</p><p>We couldn’t wait to see what players would do with our game, so we made sure it was open and available to modify all the data we had. We had hoped people would change textures, sounds, and make lots of new levels. We were enabling players to let us play their creations finally. It was a major move that would eventually end up with us releasing the source code. Open your game and your fans will own it, and keep it alive after you’re gone.</p><p>For our small team, we took these huge changes in stride and tried to use them to the edge of their capabilities. The technical stretches we made matched the design stretches we were exploring. I felt that we hit a lot of walls and climbed right over them. When Tom Hall left in August 1993, we quickly hired Sandy Petersen to help us in the final stretch. Dave Taylor came aboard to help us fill out the game.</p><p>At six developers, we were a tight team. Adrian and Kevin held down the art side confidently, while John Carmack handled the meat of the code. I loved being able to play with all of their output, and added a lot of my own code into the game’s environments to support my level designs and Sandy’s. When we were finished, we knew that we made something pretty great. We couldn’t wait for everyone else to see it. </p><p>It’s been an amazing 25 years, and I must first and foremost thank the fans that made it possible and kept it alive all this time as well as the game press who have always supported DOOM through its may iterations. Your appreciation of our work means everything. I also must thank John, Adrian, Tom, Sandy, Dave and Kevin. It was our crazy dream that made DOOM possible. Lastly, I want to thank the current DOOM team for their great work on the latest DOOM (I’m not at all involved in it, except as a player). Like everyone else, I am super excited for DOOM Eternal.</p><p>Then, here’s to a quarter century of Rip and Tear!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Big Box Extinction</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 21:35:19 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2018/4/18/big-box-extinction</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5ad7b7daaa4a996c2d47a91b</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>Game boxes used to be really cool. They had different dimensions, they took chances with very expensive designs like SUSPENDED, and before they turned into folded cardboard with a paper sleeve over it, quality of the package was really important. Witness LucasArts and Origin Systems' boxes from the 80's as exemplars of the game box.</p><p>But over time, game packaging evolved and changed. But how did the beloved PC Big Box disappear? Well, this is the short story of how it went down.</p>

We were at our first location for two years and, because our team size grew,&nbsp;we needed a bigger place. We looked at several places we could get <em>in addition</em> to the office we were already in because we really loved our first office – it was nice and cozy.</p><p>Luckily, while we were looking at extra space, a new building appeared on the market and the first day it was available we checked it out and immediately locked it in. So, several months later after much lawyering around, we got our lease, we packed up the entire old office, and moved everything to the new place. Even though we loved our first office, this new building was much bigger. We used to have half of a floor in a building, and now we have all three floors of a new one – much nicer for our growing team.</p><p>With all this moving I have found even more games and collectibles that I can put up on eBay for sale. Yesterday I put five items up and tweeted about them. One is a copy of DOOM 2 with 3.5" disks.</p>

<p>I'm currently playing Thimbleweed Park and, by 90's point-and-click-verb/noun standards, it's the best there ever was. The Secret of Monkey Island is a very tough contender because of the pirate theme, but with the character switching, playing through flashbacks, and the quality level overall, I'd say TWP is the best. Full Throttle and Grim Fandango are incredbile games that innovated beyond the verb/noun clicking and are in a class of their own. I wouldn't compare TWP to those games just like I wouldn't compare TWP to King's Quest – they're too different, even in the Adventure genre.</p><p>Now that The Witness is on iOS I'm playing that game as well. I love the navigation style – it really makes traversing a 3D environment easy for touch-screens. It's a simple premise with really fun puzzles.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Multiplayer-Only Maps</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:10:40 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2017/8/30/multiplayer-only-maps</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:59a70e4212abd9d5f9965f4f</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>As a game historian, I know it's very important to get the facts right. Figuring out the origin of significant aspects of games is important, and to document them is imperative. So, when I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/quake/quake-first-multiplayer-maps">read a story</a> that said Tim Willits invented the idea of multiplayer-only maps, I felt compelled to correct it.</p><p>The story told about how he came into the office and talked to me and Carmack about his idea, and we responded with how it was the stupidest idea we'd ever heard – this never happened (Carmack verified this to ShackNews). In fact, we had been playing multiplayer-only maps in <em>DOOM</em> for years already. There had been hundreds of maps that the <em>DOOM</em> mapping community had made only for deathmatch by that time. DWANGO was a multiplayer-only service that had many multiplayer-only maps that are legendary today. American McGee even released a multiplayer-only map in November 1994 named IDMAP01.&nbsp;The incredible <em>DOOM</em> community invented the idea of designing maps only for multiplayer mode, and they deserve the credit. The game owes so much to them.</p><p>Commercially, the first FPS's published with multiplayer-only maps at launch were Tom Hall's <em>Rise of the Triad (ROTT) </em>and<em> </em>Bungie's<em> Marathon, </em>both<em> </em>published on December 21, 1994 – 18 months before Quake's release. Marathon included 10 multiplayer-only maps. Each successive release of <em>ROTT</em> added more multiplayer-only maps. In fact, <em>ROTT</em> had several multiplayer modes beyond co-op and team deathmatch. Tom was very inventive when it came to <em>ROTT's </em>multiplayer modes and maps, long before <em>Quake</em> was released. As Tom remembers, "Yes, it had a TON of multiplayer maps. Many with unique rules, ridiculous heights, etc."</p><p>Tim cannot claim this idea as his in any way.</p>

<p>In November 1995, we had decided on a brand-new direction for Quake, so I was determining which of the maps that had been made up to that point that could be included into the new game design. The game design went through three iterations, each one simplifying the design. When Tim joined the team, his first task was to begin working on single-player maps. He then moved on to finishing some in-progress map designs of American's.</p><p>We did not have "all these fragments of maps" that were used to make the multiplayer maps in <em>Quake</em>. All multiplayer-only maps that shipped with Quake were original maps made specifically for deathmatch.</p><p>This sketch of DM3 (originally named JRBASE3) shows you it was designed only for deathmatch, and this multiplayer-only map was created by me a few weeks after Tim was hired at id Software in December 1995. I started work on DM3 on January 9, 1996, and I finished it on January 17, 1996. This means the first multiplayer-only map for Quake was created by me, and American's followed soon after. By this point, multiplayer-only maps were standard in the mod community, released in ROTT, and were beginning to feature in other FPS's (such as Outlaws) in development.</p><p>It is also important to address the issue of the map credits in the shareware version of Quake. In the article, Willits claims, "I designed the shareware episode of Quake." As one can find by looking at quake.wikia.com, the levels included in the shareware version of Quake are:</p><ul><li>Start (beginning map; available in deathmatch, too) – John Romero</li><li>E1M1 (The Slipgate Complex) – John Romero</li><li>E1M2 (Castle of the Damned ) – Tim Willits</li><li>E1M3 (The Necropolis) – Tim Willits</li><li>E1M4 (The Grisly Grotto) – Tim Willits</li><li>E1M5 (Gloom Keep) – Tim Willits</li><li>E1M6 (The Door to Chthon) – American McGee</li><li>E1M7 (The House of Chthon) – American McGee</li><li>E1M8 (Ziggurat Vertigo) – American McGee</li></ul><p>There are 9 levels in the shareware release and 4 were made by Tim. Less than half.</p><p>As a final note, I remain incredibly proud of our work at id Software and on Quake. It was a challenging project with challenging technology and this resulted in design changes, not uncommon in bleeding-edge game development. At no time was there “no design direction.” In discussing this article last night with Adrian, American, Shawn and others, and reviewing my own complete archive and design notes, Quake didn’t happen by accident. It happened by design. And that design was powered by Carmack and Abrash's ground-breaking tech with which the industry is well familiar.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Legend of Grelminar and Nemesis</title><category>history</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 14:20:52 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2017/8/28/the-legend-of-grelminar-and-nemesis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:59a4185837c5817714dfb3b2</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is part of a recent email I got:</p>

    <span>&#147;</span>I’ve recently been going through the old Catacombs and Dangerous Dave games, and I’m wondering why Commander Keen, Doomguy and Quakeguy never had a run-in with Nemesis the Lich? Seems like that guy is more immortal than Castlevania’s Dracula. Or did he turn out to have a critical weakness to Dangerous Dave’s Shotgun?<span>&#148;</span>

<p>Nemesis was a character from the D&amp;D campaign John Carmack ran in 1991 and earlier – Nemesis was a player character created and played by one of Carmack’s friends from Kansas City, Izzy. Since Nemesis belonged to that campaign you would think we would include him in Quake. Well, since Quake doesn’t really represent that D&amp;D campaign very well we decided Nemesis wasn’t a good fit. There are at least 100 characters we knew about in that campaign and we used several names from it.</p><p>I put one of the NPC names into Hexen – "Delmintalitar". I named the Time Bomb of the Ancients after him (yes, I created all the names for most everything in Heretic &amp; Hexen, too).</p><p>Also, “Nemesis the Lich” is an error. Here are examples of the character mixups on the net:</p><p>Internet archive:</p><p><a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Catacomb_3-D_1992">https://archive.org/details/msdos_Catacomb_3-D_1992</a></p><p>MobyGames:</p><p><a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/catacomb-3-d">http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/catacomb-3-d</a></p><p>In the first sentence you can see the names of Grelminar and Nemesis are reversed. MobyGames is correct. Nemesis is a guy and Grelminar is the Lich. Grelminar was also from the D&amp;D campaign but as an NPC Lich.</p>

<p>I've been playing some Quake lately. Our lead programmer was a top-ranked Quaker back in the day and it's a blast playing deathmatch 1-on-1 with him. I did a twitter poll recently asking people which game they'd like to see trivia about and Quake won this time.</p><p>DOOM had such a fast player speed. It's still so much fun deathmatching in DOOM with that speed. Quake was <strong>way slower</strong> than DOOM, and I'm sure people wondered why. So this time I'm going to explain how Quake 1 got its player speed.</p>

<p>It was going to happen sometime. Recently on Twitter I ran a poll asking people what game they'd like to see a piece of trivia about. I had Wolf, DOOM, Keen, and Quake listed. DOOM won handily with 40% of the votes.</p>

<p>I just uploaded the interview that I did with Nasir Gebelli in 1998 at my company, Ion Storm, during an Apple II Reunion that I hosted. There's a lot of great information about his history in the industry and how he got started.</p><p>Nasir wrote games entirely in assembly language and did not save source code. He didn't even have a printer to look at his code! He wrote all his NES games on an Apple II and cross-developed them to the NES hardware. Even the SNES game, Secret of Mana, was coded on an Apple II, in 65816 assembly with no source.</p><p>I've been talking to Nasir recently about doing an in-depth interview.

<p>I just got some stub pages up for the bigger games like Wolf 3D, DOOM, Quake, etc. I rescued a few of my oldest game entries from the Wayback Machine, too: Crazy Climber, Alien Attack, and Bongo's Bash.</p><p>I decided to update the game pages and put gameplay video of the games on them (as well as download links for emulators). It's crazy to think that I can play a game I wrote in 1982 in an Apple II emulator, inside a Windows 10 emulator, on my macOS (Mac Pro), and record video of that from a macOS app. Gotta love it!</p><p>I figured the gameplay videos are nice for people wondering what my oldest games looked like in case downloading and setting up an emulator is a hassle.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Happy 26th Birthday, Commander Keen!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2016 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2016/12/27/happy-26th-birthday-commander-keen</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:586278d5e58c620a62cb1ed5</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Man, 26 years.

<p>It's that time of year again, where we say Happy Birthday to one of my most favorite games, DOOM! Every year I try to reveal something about the game's development that hasn't been documented to death. Believe me, DOOM has been documented more than most games. But never fear, I have so much stuff that no one has seen that I could do this forever. Of course, I'm limited in what I can release, so it's going to be something simple and maybe known already.</p><p>When we decided to create The Ultimate DOOM, we had a name for it internally since the title "The Ultimate DOOM" wasn't created until just before we released it in 1995. Internally, we called it <strong>The Special Edition</strong>. On our development drive we had a directory during original DOOM development called "data" that had all the game's data files (level WADs, palette, text screens, etc.) The directory for The Ultimate DOOM was "data_se" for Special Edition.</p><p>We had a utility called WADLINK that read a script file and put a WAD together. Yes, our Novell Netware file server directory was called FLEM. Um, yes, the $shootwad command really happened. Here's a little of the beginning of that file:</p><pre class="source-code">;===================================================

<p>We're getting very close to completing development on Gunman Taco Truck, Donovan's first soon-to-be-published game. There's no release date yet as our publisher will be spending some time checking it out. It's been a blast working on it; such fun times. I've been tweeting some info and images recently and people sound pretty excited to check it out. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Twenty years. Wow. Where has all the time gone? We've all had many adventures during those years and Quake spawned many a game franchise and/or game company whether directly or through its influence.</p><p>For this 20th I'm going to share a document created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/joostschuur">Joost Shuur</a> called QUAKETALK 95. This Quake FAQ was created on 10/22/1995 to keep people up to date on everything that had been posted about Quake up to that point. People wanted to know what the game was about and information was spread thin all over the place: magazine articles, IRC logs, even in hint books.</p><p>Joost did a great job scraping this information together. You can see the original design thinking behind Quake while we were making it. Just one month after this QUAKETALK 95 FAQ was released was our fateful, big company meeting that determined the final direction of the game into the Quake that was released. It bears little resemblance to the designs discussed here but it lets you see how volatile game design processes can be.</p>

<p>On August 3, 1995, I released the first screenshots of Quake to the internet. Here's the text file that was included with the pics and those original 320x200 pics enlarged so you can view them without squinting.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">Quake screen shots
Released August 3rd, 1995

Here they are - at long last!  The very first screens shots of Quake, taken at 320x200 resolution.  Screens q15.tif and q16.tif are high-res 640x480 24-bit TIFF color screens, just so you can see the awesome lighting. The cool Quake lighting can be seen in all these screen shots (except the de1m5-? ones, which are DOOM screen shots) and a couple sprites and an Alias model as well.  We don't have any Alias models working in the game at this point, but we're &gt;this&lt; close to getting them fully implemented with movement, proper light sourcing and animation. Screen q6.gif has our dragon hovering above a bridge above a moat.

The screen shots prefixed by qe1m5 are to be compared against their DOOM counterparts, the screen shots prefixed by de1m5.  Obviously, these are screens from DOOM episode 1, level 5.  I duplicated the level and Quakeified it and you can see for yourself how cool it looks compared to the original.

In q3.gif, you will see a couple torches at the end of the hall. Those are old DOOM torches, just holding a spot for the new ones, so don't worry - we're not shabbing out some old graphics on ya. The same goes for the numbers at the bottom of every screen shot, which are DOOM's status bar number graphics.

In the screens where you see some pink/purple sky - that sky parallaxes and is spherically mapped. You can just imagine the wind whistling in your ears...

You should see these screens in action. :)

Other posts will address Corona as a better place to start.</p><p>I believe anyone wanting to learn programming should start with the basics, and that means the C language. It also means no graphics so the focus is on the language itself and understanding just the language, and not an IDE or environment like Flash. You can do plenty of good learning just by using text mode.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step walkthrough of how to get Xcode set up for programming simple console apps like you would find in any basic C book.</p><h3>STEP 1: Install Xcode 4</h3><p>It's in the Mac App Store. Search for Xcode then get it. I believe it's free. Next, after it's downloaded, you need to run the app called "Install Xcode" (if you're running Lion, you can find it by clicking the silver rocket ship dock icon). That is what will really install it. When that's done, you can move on to step 2.</p><h3>STEP 2: Create a New Project</h3><p>This is the first thing you will see. Make sure you choose "Create a new Xcode project".</p><p> </p><p>Next, choose "Mac OS X", then "Application".</p><p>Then choose "Command Line Tool". Click Next.</p><p> </p><p>Now choose the options for your project, and where to put it.</p><p>Click Next.</p><p> </p><p>Make sure to UNCHECK the option to create a git repository. You're just starting to learn to code - source control can come later.</p><p> </p><h3>STEP 3: Set Up The Project Window</h3><p>Now the project will start up in a window that will look confusing since you're not used to this kind of information. Don't worry — you don't need to know about this yet, and you can get rid of it so you can focus only on your code.</p><p>First, select your <strong>main.c</strong>&nbsp;source by clicking on the name in the left pane.</p><p> </p><p>Next, let's get rid of all the bothersome info. Click on the View buttons so they're all off like this.</p><p> </p><p>Now you should be looking only at pure code.</p><p>Click on the PLAY button at the top-left to run the simple main() code that was generated for you. It will open up an output window at the bottom of the edit area.</p><p>Now, make the output area fill the screen from left to right by clicking the View buttons like so:</p><p> </p><p>There! Now you have pure code and pure output!</p><p>To clean up the output and make it only show you your code output and no compilation messages, change the pulldown menu from All Output to Target Output.</p><p>Finally, I don't like coding with a solid white background blasting my retinas all day, so I always choose a dark scheme.</p><p>To do this, press Command-, (comma) to bring up Preferences. Choose <strong>Fonts &amp; Color</strong>. On the left pane, choose the theme <strong>Midnight</strong>. Your screen would look just like this...</p><p> </p><p>That's all there is to setting up a new console-only C project in Xcode with a simple environment! This is the view that my girlfriend Brenda prefers because it's easy to just focus on her code.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Latest Update &#x26; DOOM Post-Mortem</title><category>history</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2012 15:24:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/latest-update-doom-post-mortem</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d8d85c21b865cfe7e3f9e</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Wow, it's been a long time since I wrote anything here... thank you very much, Facebook.

That's what I wanted to find out with Ravenwood Fair.</strong></em></p><p>I wanted to make a social game last year, so my girlfriend Brenda told her employers (Lolapps, Inc., a social game developer in San Francisco, California) that I was interested. I started consulting in August 2010, designed the game in a few days, and got the team working on what I decided to call <a href="http://facebook.com/ravenwoodfair"><em>Ravenwood Fair</em></a>. At the beginning, I did art direction toward a painterly style until the lead artist, Christine MacTernan, totally got the look and took over from there. I created and coded all the sound effects, and worked with a great composer named <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,141624/">Aaron Walz</a>&nbsp;from <a target="_blank" href="http://gameaudioalliance.com">Game Audio Alliance</a>&nbsp;on the game's looping soundtrack. He did an excellent job, as the song can be played infinitely without annoyance - the true test of a great composition.</p><p>The team was very small: four programmers, two concept artists, two animators, a UI artist, a producer, Brenda and me. That's only 12 people. In addition, the game launched on October 19, which means it took 2.5 months to go from concept to ship. This causes many a social game publisher to gasp, but there's a good reason for it: the team worked very hard, and they had already been working on several game concepts for 7 months before I showed up, so they were already "at speed" and no ramp-up time was needed.</p><p>When I arrived at Lolapps, the owners told me I could create whatever, as long as the game would make money and launch by September 30. That was less than 2 months by the time I started working on it. I knew I had to hurry up and come up with a concept, so I quickly identified the best game on Facebook at the time,&nbsp;<em>FrontierVille</em>, and played it for three days so I could understand its design patterns and monetization model (I had been following the social game space since 2009). Then, I got the scoop on the engine we were using and found out it was really fast and could draw a ton of graphics on the screen quickly. I learned from the lead coder how much code had been written for the previous game prototypes, so I needed to use as much as possible to keep moving forward and not go backward much.</p><p>The idea for the game appeared very quickly. The setting was going to be a fairytale/storybook/magical place that floated in the air and was occupied by a slightly scary forest. Since the biggest games on Facebook were business sims, I needed to have the player build their own little business, and I wanted it to be like nothing else on Facebook. I thought a Fair would be a really nice obvious positive goal for the player to build, and there wasn't a carnival/circus/fair sim on Facebook......yet. My thought was this: when you're building a place for visitors to come and occupy, why wouldn't you want them to be doing something really fun while they're there? What's more fun than <em>Disneyland</em>? I imagined what it must be like at a high-level point-of-view to actually RUN <em>DisneyWorld</em>&nbsp;in Orlando, Florida - to have to carve out a bunch of wilderness packed with alligators and other denizens, and then have to build a fun place in the middle of that - and KEEP it happy and fun, all the while the alligators and beasts want their place back. I figured that would be a fun game to play - as I cut back a scary forest, I build a Fair, visitors come and use all the things I'm building, and I get to interact with them in a light fashion. That was the basis of my design, so we had our first meeting, and the producer and leads wrote down the long list of things that we needed to start working on immediately.</p><p>After August, we were still working on the foundations of the game systems and entire art overhaul, when Brenda joined the team from <em>Critter Island </em>(it had been shut down by Facebook). Brenda immediately started working on the quests, the map layout, and the tutorial parts of the game. She had to basically try to get all the final parts of the game together while I was still working on the foundational stuff, and we had to make sure that they would meet in the middle and the game would be complete by September 30.</p><p>Near the end of September, to make the launch date, the game had been re-scoped and re-prioritized so much that it wasn't going to be anything I'd want to play if we shipped it in that state. Facebook games are well-known to ship incomplete and get fixed post-launch. I'm not from that world - I'm from the world of "You only launch once" and the first impression is extremely important. There were game systems missing that absolutely needed to be included in the game for the design to harmonize, and it got very tense at the end of September with the execs pressing for launch and me holding the game back to make it great. Every day in October was a "Can it ship?" day. It took 19 more 12pm-to-4am days to get the game in a state that I'd launch. In fact, I held back on doing interviews about the game until I knew it was going to be something I'd put my name on. Finally, around October 15, the game was quality enough for me to do the <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/10/19/creator-of-the-fierce-doom-and-quake-games-tries-his-hand-at-a-cute-facebook-game/">Dean Takahashi interview in VentureBeat</a>.</p><p>The game launched, but the team kept working. We had lots of holes to fill, and obscure bugs to fix. The launch on Facebook went as good as a launch could possibly go: millions of people played the game and hundreds of thousands still join every week. Brenda and I ended our consulting with Lolapps on February 25, 2011 so we could concentrate full-time on our new startup,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://lootdrop.com">Loot Drop, Inc.</a></p><p>Just recently at the beginning of March, Ravenwood Fair made the #15 slot on the <a target="_blank" href="http://appdata.com">AppData</a>&nbsp;Top 15 Applications list - this list is of ALL applications on Facebook, not just games (over 125,000 apps are on Facebook).&nbsp;<em>Ravenwood Fair</em>&nbsp;is the #1 non-Zynga game, and that's quite an accomplishment.&nbsp;<strong>Currently, over 25 million people play Ravenwood Fair every month on all social platforms</strong>&nbsp;(over 11 million on Facebook alone), and over 1 million play every day on Facebook only. I never thought I'd see the day that I would make a game that <strong><em>doubled</em></strong>&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a>, player count-wise. I'd like to thank Brenda and Lolapps for giving me the opportunity, and the <em>Ravenwood Fair</em>&nbsp;launch team that worked so hard on the game.</p><p><strong>Ravenwood Fair Trivia Time!</strong></p><ul><li>Except John and Brenda, the team that developed and launched <em>Ravenwood Fair</em>&nbsp;had never made a game before.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The loading screen graphic has <a target="_blank" href="http://frontierville.wikia.com/wiki/Frontier_Jack">Frontier Jack's</a>&nbsp;skeleton buried underground - it's a reference to FrontierVille, and a statement that we were out to bury him.

My original plan was to have the game check to see if the player had 19 pumpkins close to each other, and if so, make a great pumpkin ghost randomly appear. The 19 was a reference to our ship date, since it was in October.</li><li>The magical substance called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/Vitalin">Vitalin</a>&nbsp;originally appeared in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen">Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine</a>.</li><li>The Sleeping Potion is a reference to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_beauty">Sleeping Beauty</a>, but no need to stab your finger on a spinning wheel - just drink the potion.</li><li>The first quest is titled <a target="_blank" href="http://support.lolapps.com/entries/471012-dethorning-faq">Secret of the Forest</a>. It's the name of one of my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPjRTvMAptg">favorite Chrono Trigger songs</a>.</li><li>The buildings hidden in the forest for the player to uncover are a reference back to the game <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)">Civilization</a>.</li><li>Originally, I spelled the game's name <em>Ravenwood Faire</em>. This resulted in a big discussion over the name that entailed A/B advertisement testing, and numerous wasteful discussions. Eventually, they decided to keep the name but drop the 'e' on Faire. The big hulabaloo was that people would think the game is about Renaissance Fairs. Which, evidently, is bad? The game takes place in a medieval time. It's a Fair. So, to compensate, I named the market <strong><em>Ye Olde Shoppe</em></strong>&nbsp;with an 'e' after each word. Then, I designed the expansion pack and called it <strong><em>Ravenrock Mine - that's Mine with an 'e' on the end!</em></strong>&nbsp;Later on, we found out that Ravenrock Mine is a part of the Elder Scrolls world, so I renamed it to <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/02/22/lolapps-launches-a-novel-expansion-for-ravenwood-fair-facebook-game/">Ravenstone Mine</a>. Still, with the 'e' on the end. As of right now, it's still not launched - and that's <em>another</em>&nbsp;story.</li><li>The protectors in the game were originally called Super Decorations. I wanted to have decorations that were way cooler than fences, trees, rocks, etc. Decorations that danced with the visitors in your Fair. So, we created a bunch of them and they don't look anything like Vitalin Cannons, but that's what they turned into. You see, while in development, Brenda told me that she didn't feel good leaving the game because her visitors would be scared by the forest and the monsters she left there. She wanted something that would make her feel that it was okay to leave the game. So, I came up with the idea to make the Super Decorations shoot balls of Vitalin magic at the monsters and scary forest. That made her feel better. Then I renamed the Super Decorations to Vita-Decos for a couple days, then changed the name to something that made sense: Protectors. They're alive because they tap into the Vitalin that's in the very rocks of Ravenwood. At the edge of the map, you can see some Vitalin in the rocks.</li><li>The Crittle Bear got its name like this: before settling on mushrooms as the food you get as a drop in the game, I wanted to come up with a food that the animal visitors in your Fair would eat. The word was a merger of Critter and Vittles: Crittle. The food in the game was going to look like little brown triangles (probably like dog food) and was going to be named Crittle until I looked up the word on the net. It turns out that Crittle is urban slang for Crystal Meth! So, I decided to go with mushrooms for food (they live on trees anyway), and since the Bear looks like he's messed up, I named him the Crittle Bear since he's probably been doing too much crittle and now he attacks visitors.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domovoi">The Domovoi is from Russian folklore</a>. Domovoi typically live inside the house as a friendly spirit, but since the previous occupants of Ravenwood have up and left, they also left their Domovoi, who is mad and attacks you, the newcomer. Supposedly, the Domovoi is still protecting the previous master's house.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grock">Grock was a famous clown in the early 1900's</a>, so I named the clown monster after him. Many of my references are to refresh the memory of those who've gone before us.</li><li>When you build the Gingerbread House, a new visitor appears named Hansel. This was done against my wishes. Originally, I had named the gingerbread man visitor Nuremberg. Why? Well, not because of the Nazi trials, of course, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lebkuchen.nuernberg.de/englische_version/vielfalt.html"><strong>because Nuremberg has been famous for centuries for its gingerbread!</strong></a>&nbsp;At the last minute before rolling the gingerbread house content out, one of the owners of Lolapps had the name changed to prevent players from possibly being offended. Were you all offended by <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>?</li><li>Bumble the snow monster is named after the character in the Rankin/Bass Christmas special,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_(TV_special)#Additional_characters">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a>.</li><li>One night, some coders came up with the idea of having Huginn wear a monocle, so the UI artist added it to him. I thought that having Huginn look like he's a young raven, but wearing a monocle, would be cute. Like he's trying to act smart just by wearing the monocle.</li><li>The crow that flies up and out of the forest and past "the camera" was influenced mainly by the scene in <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>&nbsp;where you actually reach the island in chapter 3 and see a bird fly past the camera and down to the island - the reverse of what I do in <em>Ravenwood</em>, but still very cool-looking. It's actually similar to the scene in the game <em>LOOM</em>&nbsp;where the Cleric's head is ripped off by Chaos and flies into the camera. Making the crow look as good as it does required a lot of animator revision and direction. It had to be redone a few times before it looked the way I wanted it to.</li><li>The development of the Ravenwood Theme song took quite a while. I contacted Soundrangers to see if they could create original compositions to spec. We had just gotten them to modify the title song that I had picked out for Critter Island (it was in the music section on Soundrangers' site) and I wanted to see what they could do with an original piece. Soon, they came to Lolapps and I had a meeting with them where I explained to Aaron Walz exactly what kind of song I wanted. When I'm choosing music for my games, I'll usually give reference music or a specific reference song to the composer and tell them what I'm looking for and why the reference song is important. With Ravenwood, the reference song is called <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj8zw8rrUhM">Beware the Forest's Mushrooms</a></em>&nbsp;and was composed by the amazing <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Shimomura">Yoko Shimomura</a>&nbsp;for Nintendo's game,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_mario_rpg"><em>Super Mario RPG</em>&nbsp;</a>(1996). She was born the day <em>Ravenwood Fair</em>&nbsp;launched and during my birth year (9 days before I was born!) The song is a little fast for something that is going to play a million times, but the way the song is very positive with just a hint of scary (as a reference to the scary forest) made it perfect for Ravenwood. I wanted Aaron to compose a song JUST LIKE IT. After almost a month of work on the song, it sounded nothing like Yoko's song, but had its own unique identity and I love it.</li><li>Originally, I had a song playing during the game's loading screen. It sounded just like a medieval Fair and was really great. Unfortunately, it took too much bandwidth for most folks playing the game, so instead I created the Ravenwood Signature sound to play as soon as the loading screen came up.</li><li>The Giant Snowman named Daglow is named after <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Daglow">Don Daglow</a>, a legend in the game industry.</li><li>Putting credits in social games is not done currently. It's very sad to see so many coders, artists and designers not getting credit for their work, something they could see on MobyGames. At Lolapps, Brenda and I fought hard for credits in Ravenwood. Just type the word 'credits' anytime you're playing the game. At Loot Drop, however, credits will always be viewable.</li></ul>]]></description></item><item><title>id Software: 20 Years Old Today!</title><category>id software</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2011 15:27:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/id-software-20-years-old-today</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d8e58a976afcb548af4df</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>When John Carmack, Adrian Carmack and I officially started our first day at the lakehouse on Cross Lake in Shreveport, Louisiana, we had absolutely no idea that our company would last twenty years.</p><p>After three months, Tom Hall officially joined us in May 1991. He wanted his transition from Softdisk to go smoothly, so he stayed to train his replacement. Our first year at id was spent mostly developing games for Softdisk's <em>Gamer's Edge</em>&nbsp;subscription disk - the product I started, but then left when the company could hold us no longer.</p><p>In our first year, 1991, we created <em>Shadow Knights, Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion, Rescue Rover, Hovertank One, Rescue Rover II, Keen Dreams, Commander Keen: Secret of the Oracle, Commander Keen: The Armageddon Machine, Commander Keen: Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter!, Catacomb 3D</em>&nbsp;and <em>Tiles of the Dragon</em>. Eleven games in one year! Not counting the Keen games, Softdisk paid us $5,000 for each game. It was a good thing our first <em>Commander Keen</em>&nbsp;trilogy was making money and gaining each month, otherwise our trajectory would have been drastically different. (In the halls of id Software, some of these games are on display in hanging frames.)</p><p>When we started creating <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>&nbsp;in January 1992 (in Madison, Wisconsin), we still had one more game to create for Softdisk, but we didn't want to do it. We were too excited to create <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>! So, George Broussard, co-founder of Apogee Software/3D Realms, offered to create the final game for us. The result of his labors, using our game engine, was the rare and obscure game,&nbsp;<em>ScubaVenture: The Search For Pirate's Treasure</em>! (An interesting trivia point about the game's title: one of my programming heroes, Nasir Gebelli, wrote a game called <em>ScubaVenture</em>&nbsp;back in 1983.)</p><p>Our first year was the last time we were so prolific. As the games got more complex, and better, the time to develop them grew.&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein 3D </em>took 6 months,&nbsp;<em>DOOM</em>&nbsp;took one year,&nbsp;<em>Quake</em>&nbsp;took 18 months. In between, our sequels took less time (Spear of Destiny, 2 months; DOOM II, 8 months), but they were using existing code we'd already written.</p><p>Twenty years, wow. That is quite an impressive accomplishment, due in large part to the torch-carrying efforts of John Carmack and Kevin Cloud, both of whom remain at id Software today. May id Software live another strong 20 years!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Making Mail.app Act Like Gmail</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2011 15:29:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/making-mailapp</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d8e9ea976afcb548af698</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I use GMail a lot, and love the Archive feature. The problem is that when I use Mail.app on my iMac it doesn't have an Archive button or Archive the messages when I delete them. It actually DELETES THEM, which is not what I want. So, I figured out how to do this in a real easy way.</p><p>In Mail.app:</p><p>1) Near the bottom, expand your <strong>GMail</strong>&nbsp;folder<br />2) Expand the <strong>[Gmail]</strong>&nbsp;folder inside<br />3) Select the <strong>All Mail</strong>&nbsp;folder inside<br />4) Go to the menu item <strong>Mailbox &gt;&gt; Use this mailbox for... &gt;&gt; Trash</strong><br />5) Collapse the Gmail folder now; no need to look at it again<br />6) Press <strong>Command-,</strong>&nbsp;(comma) for Preferences<br />7) Select <strong>Accounts</strong>&nbsp;tab<br />8) Select the same Gmail account in the Accounts list<br />9) Click <strong>Mailbox behaviors</strong><br />10) In the Trash section,&nbsp;<strong>KEEP CHECKED</strong>&nbsp;"Move deleted message to the Trash mailbox"<br />11)&nbsp;<strong>UNCHECK</strong>&nbsp;"Store deleted messages on the server"<br />12) Set "Permanently erase deleted messages when:" to <strong>NEVER</strong><br />13) Close the Preferences window and click <strong>SAVE</strong></p><p>Voila! Now when you delete messages from your Inbox, they get Archived. You can double-check this by logging into Gmail and deleting a message in Mail.app then refreshing your web Gmail inbox. I'm using Mail.app version 4.4, but i'm sure this setup works on many previous versions.</p><p>In addition, if you want your Mail.app emails to look just like GMails with threaded conversations, make sure you're viewing your GMail account, then go to <strong>View &gt;&gt; Organize by Thread.</strong></p>]]></description></item><item><title>Sierra Adventure #0: Mission Oakhurst</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2010 14:32:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/sierra-adventure-0-mission-oakhurst</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d8f11d8af104b68fdb419</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Over the course of the last year, I've been working on a <a href="http://romeroarchives.com">project to document the history of game design</a>, and I've interviewed everyone from Sid Meier to Noah Falstein to Nasir Gebelli. As a part of that, this weekend, I set out to find the legendary game company Sierra On-Line. Unencumbered by research, my girlfriend Brenda and I spontaneously decided Friday night to leave Saturday morning for the Yosemite area.</p><p class="">I visited Sierra On-Line back in 1992, but that's a GameTales entry I need to write, and won't give away here. Oakhurst is approximately a 4 hour trip from our house through beautiful country, so we took the BMW Z4. Around 4pm we checked into our hotel room in Madera, CA, about 45 minutes from the Oakhurst area. We then continued on our mission. Around 5pm we reached the intersection of CA-41 and Raymond Rd., the beginning of Coarsegold. As we cruised down the street, we saw a Mexican restaurant named Alfonso's - surely a good omen, and oh, we would be eating there, of course. On we continued for another 8 miles or so until we reached the outskirts of Oakhurst.</p><p class="">Coming down the hill, the first business we see is on our left, and it's Erna's Elderberry House. I actually had dinner there in 1992, so it’s been around for a while. Since we had no idea where the actual address of Sierra was, we pulled over at a gas station to sit in the car and do some internet searching.</p><p class="">We pulled up next to a car. Someone was sitting in the driver’s seat with the window down. I knew that Sierra basically owned this town when they were functional, and probably everyone in the town knew that Sierra was a game company long ago. I rolled down the window and asked the person, “Hi. Do you know the game company Sierra that used to be in town?” “Yeah, just about everyone in town worked there. My uncle used to work in the warehouse.” I asked,”Do you know the address of the building?” The guy said,”No, but the bartender at Erna’s has been working there for over 20 years. Maybe he knows.” I said thanks, and we drove back up to Erna’s.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Duke Nukem Forever Returns</title><category>development</category><category>press</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2010 14:33:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/duke-nukem-forever-returns</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d8fc7df40f3a73184ad91</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I've been asked several times by people on Twitter what I think about <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>&nbsp;having an actual due date; that the game might actually come out.</p><p>Well, I think it's awesome for several reasons. First, because I've been a huge Duke fan since <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>. I absolutely loved that game. My memories of playing DN3D are as awesome as my memories playing <em>Dark Forces, Outlaws, Jedi Knight</em>, and <em>Ghost Recon</em>. Secondly, I've been friends for years with Randy Pitchford, the man who bought the Duke IP from 3D Realms; to carry the torch as it were. I'm really proud of Randy for doing that - Duke is a great character that deserves another major release, and I'm interested to see what directions Gearbox will take Duke in the future.</p><p>I visited 3D Realms in May 2000, right after shipping <em>Daikatana</em>. I went over to check out the latest on DNF. George Broussard showed me the game, and it was seriously awesome. Granted, I was seeing the best stuff they had available at the time, but what I saw was really great. I was excited to play the game. Alas, development of the game went through many changes, and not having a dedicated producer early on took its toll. When I heard 3D Realms had halted development of the game, I was half surprised, and half not. It had been 12 years, and that's an incredibly long time to be in development - I mean, it's really incomprehensible. I can't fathom what it must feel like working on a game that long, then not releasing it, especially if you were there at the start of development.</p><p>But now we can all breathe a sigh of relief, those of us who kept the excitement at bay for so long. The Duke Nukem Forever development team that continued creating the game, even after being laid off, without being paid, for the pure love of the game, deserve an epic amount of applause and attention. These guys are the heroes. And I'm still excited to play DNF.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>GameTales: HomeCourt</title><category>development</category><category>gametales</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2010 14:35:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/gametales-homecourt</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d900ddf40f3a73184af98</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>I recently tweeted about the fact that there was actually a sequel, mostly finished, for Origin Systems' game,&nbsp;<em>2400 A.D.</em>&nbsp;titled <em>2500 A.D.</em>&nbsp;MobyGames and Wikipedia were updated with the information which prompted someone on my TwitterFeed to ask about an unreleased Origin game titled <em>HomeCourt</em>.</p><p>Luckily, I'm one of the few people to know about this project.&nbsp;<em>HomeCourt</em>&nbsp;was a basketball game designed by two brothers, Don and John Walker. They were stronger on the design side than the coding side, so they had help from classic game programmer, Steve Meuse. I believe the game idea was brought to Origin in 1987 to make a full court basketball game (<em>One on One</em>&nbsp;was a half-court game).</p><p>Steve Meuse worked with the brothers, mostly with Don, to get a graphical prototype working. The prototype had players on a projected 2D court running around and passing the ball on an Apple II. I saw this prototype working once when Don Walker was visiting, and it looked pretty nice. It was black and white graphics at the time, and the running and ball-passing worked great. Unfortunately, Steve left Origin in 1988 shortly after I left to co-found my studio, Inside Out Software.</p><p>The New Hampshire office of Origin Systems closed, and the company was consolidated in Austin, TX at the start of 1989. That effectively put an end to <em>HomeCourt</em>. Says Steve Meuse, "The game design aspect was getting more complex, and by the time I left Origin in 1988, it seemed to me to be only getting moreso. With the company move and all, the Walkers probably could have used more help and guidance than they got, but that's just the way things turned out."</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Unintended Acceleration</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2010 14:40:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/unintended-acceleration</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d915c1115e08749291825</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I was reading CNN today and there was a story about a guy whose Toyota randomly started accelerating and he crashed into two cars at 70mph. This was back in 2006 before all the recent Toyota issues. The man has finally been freed as the court found it wasn't his fault.</p><p>It brought back the memory of how the same thing happened to me back in 1991 when I was working on Commander Keen 4-6. I was driving my brown 1975 Cougar in the winter down a pretty short road that was just in front of id's apartment. I had the accelerator down to get some speed, and when I took my foot off the car kept accelerating! I started messing with the pedal but it didn't stop. I realized the smartest thing was to put the car in neutral and hit the brakes before I got to the intersection. It worked and I quickly pulled over and popped the hood while the car engine was whining loudly as it was still accelerating. I pulled the fuel hose out to stop the engine and then pulled back on the accelerator cable to get it back to normal. That was pretty terrifying for about 30 seconds.</p><p>The reason the accelerator got jacked is because I changed the cable assembly because the previous one broke. But it wasn't calibrated correctly and the cable snagged on something that time.</p><p>The lesson? DON'T TRY TO FIX YOUR OWN CAR! Lol.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Gamesauce #2!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2010 23:44:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/gamesauce-2</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d91971115e087492919f8</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>There's a new magazine in town for game developers, and its name is <a target="_blank" href="http://gamesauce.org">Gamesauce</a>.

And, you guessed it, that was me. It also has my name on the cover, so that kinda gives it away.</p><p>The cover of the magazine is Wolfenstein 3D (much like another issue several months before that was all about the making of Wolf 3D). I got to read/edit all the magazine content before they published it, and I made comments about several of the articles. The biggest part of the magazine I'm involved with is a 12-page interview with me. There are also industry notables who wrote some paragraphs about me, and readers wrote in about their favorite games of mine.</p><p>All in all, I was very happy with the result. Darran Jones did a tremendous job planning and executing this feature. Retro Gamer is sold in most major bookstores.</p><p>Retro Gamer put out a press release about this issue:</p><blockquote><p>PRESS RELEASE<br />For Immediate Release<br />30 March 2010</p><p>Retro Gamer gains industry legend as guest Editor</p><p>John Romero and Imagine Publishing team up for special issue of the world's greatest retro games magazine, Retro Gamer, is proud to announce an exciting new collaboration with John Romero, co-founder of one of today's most important and popular genres - the first-person shooter.</p><p>On Wednesday 31 March, issue 75 of Retro Gamer goes on sale across the UK and the world with a special celebration issue featuring industry legend John Romero as guest Editor. As well as a host of special content picked by Romero, the issue is packed with comments, tributes and insights from those who have worked with him over the years, such as John Carmack and Dave Perry. The special issue also includes an exhaustive 12-page interview with the man himself, outlining his career, his thoughts on the industry today, and his intriguing current project.</p><p>Making his name at companies such as Origin Systems and Softdisk, Romero cut his programming teeth on the Apple II before moving into the PC market. Teaming up with fellow Softdisk workers John Carmack, Adrian Carmack and Tom Hall, he co-formed id Software. After finding success in the shareware scene with the Commander Keen games, id created Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, and with them ushered in a new era of gaming that's still immensely popular today.</p><p>"I absolutely love Retro Gamer magazine because it covers all the game history that I love and remember fondly," said Romero. "Being allowed the chance to do a little writing for the magazine was an amazing opportunity and I hope you all enjoy it the way I did."</p><p>"John Romero is a genuine legend in the videogame industry," said Darran Jones, Editor of Retro Gamer, "and he has been behind some of the most influential games this industry has ever seen. It's been a real pleasure collaborating with him on this exciting project."</p></blockquote>]]></description></item><item><title>Commander Genius</title><category>id software</category><category>press</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2010 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/commander-genius</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566d92fed8af104b68fdcf86</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is pretty incredible.

We were our own QA team, us programmers, designers and artists. A pretty small group, but we were pretty thorough.

Now, the issues he fixed are just part of normal network programming.</p><p>The day we released <em>QTest</em>, we invited a very small, select group of hardcore <em>DOOM</em>&nbsp;players to our office to test our release right in front of us.

We had already shipped Wolfenstein 3D, the shareware episode only at that point, and were working on finishing the rest of the 6 episodes. Bobby Prince was in the house busy making the music for those last 5 episodes. Bobby brought his entire audio rig with him which consisted of a huge sampling keyboard, speakers, and a rack with lots of effects units.</p><p>id Software was working out of a one-bedroom loft apartment at La Prada Club in Mesquite, Texas. The six of us lived at La Prada or at adjacent complexes, so getting to work was only a couple minutes. We didn't think that was strange; we were on a mission.</p><p>Whenever Bobby left for the night, Tom and I would start playing around with his sampling keyboard. We came up with some crazy songs, and somehow we decided to come up with some answering machine messages. There were a bunch of samples already in the keyboard, and we came up with these right on the spot with no practice.</p><p>I used samples from some Judas Priest and W.A.S.P. songs as intros, and also a Vince Guaraldi song for one. Most of the answering machine "stories" are about a huge, red demon that is looking for id Software and showed up just after id escaped the building. Tom is the guy interviewing the demon, who then tires of Tom when he has no information about id's whereabouts and instantly destroys him. Or throws him down the stairs. This happens again and again.</p><p>The recordings are a little high-pitched and missing some bass to them. We only used a couple of these on the answering machine, and then Jay took them off and recorded a more corporate message, thus ending the fun.</p><p>Until now, only a few people knew about, and heard, these messages. I shall release the Kraken!</p>

Tom and I were getting tired of the one we created back in the Keen days and before we released Wolfenstein 3D, Kevin fired up Adobe Illustrator on NeXTSTEP and created the id logo in a day.</p><p>Fast forward to Quake development in 1996, and while I was working with Sasha Shor on all the Quake packaging and marketing materials, I decided to change the id logo. The game we were making, Quake, was meant to be violent, disturbing and unsettling. It was supposed to, as much as we could, directly represent what the word "id" meant. Our clean, neat id logo didn't match the game or the package design that was shaping up.</p><p>I told Sasha,"I want you to fuck up the logo.

It makes me wonder: how many people working at id right now actually know that?</p><p>Next year will be two decades of <em>Keen</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em>,&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>, and <em>Quake</em>. How many game companies still standing can boast 20 years? Not many. And most companies that live past 20 years are so far removed from their origins that they're not even the same company.</p><p>John Carmack and Kevin Cloud, two of id's earliest team members, and John as a co-founder, are still with the company, and working hard on <em>RAGE</em>&nbsp;and <em>Doom 4</em>. John is right down in the pit with the development team, where all the action happens. Kevin manages, as always, exceptionally well on multiple fronts. I salute their efforts to continue the dynasty.</p><p>It all started on February 1, 1991. John, Adrian and I left our jobs at Softdisk (R.I.P.) and began work immediately on <em>Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion</em>&nbsp;at the <a target="_blank" href="http://romero.smugmug.com/Video-Games/The-Archives/07010043/104398016_u7Pab-X3.jpg">id lake house in Shreveport, Louisiana</a>. Tom Hall needed to stay a few months longer at Softdisk, to help them ease his transition out of the Apple II team. But after work, he'd come over and help out.</p><p>Those were prolific years. The years 1990 and 1991 saw us develop almost 20 games with wildly different play styles and themes. The <em>Keens</em>, The <em>Dangerous Daves</em>, the <em>Rescue Rovers</em>, the <em>Catacombs</em>, and more. There were a lot of them and all were fun.&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>&nbsp;begat the first-person shooter genre in 1992, and id hasn't looked back.</p><p>Congratulations on 19 years, id!</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4/1450025476164-CKOD1UXIQKJG3VI2B1KH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmwbA6upbL5Bu97tJociXJklKprRMdH2Tl4F1PjaoPT3YUs5wkl5ojCV1O900UJ7ME/image-asset.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1024" height="1024"><media:title type="plain">Happy Birthday id Software</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>GameTales: Cray 6400</title><category>gametales</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2010 17:05:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/gametales-cray-ymp</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566da53c2399a3bdabbd8ee3</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>At id, we were always looking for a better way to develop our games. In the beginning we developed games for DOS machines <em>on DOS machines.</em>&nbsp;In 1991, John Carmack investigated the NeXTSTEP operating system, and decided that cross-development on a superior platform would result in a better game and a better development experience. We all converted over to NeXTSTEP at the end of 1992, after <em>Spear of Destiny</em>.</p><p>Because we were developing on such powerful machines in an amazing operating system, development of <em>Doom</em>&nbsp;went faster than normal. The level editor that I wrote,&nbsp;<em>DoomEd</em>, was far beyond anything that ever appeared on DOS, even in the years after <em>Doom's</em>&nbsp;release. We could run <em>Doom</em>&nbsp;in a window and debug its code right alongside it in <em>SuperDebugger</em>. It was bliss.</p><p>While developing <em>Quake</em>, we continued to use NeXTSTEP and we upgraded our machines to faster ones with Intel processors and a couple with PowerPC's in them. NeXTSTEP could run on about 4 chip architectures back then and compile code for all of them so we could run <em>QuakeEd</em>, for example, on an Intel-chipped NeXTSTEP machine even if it was developed on a 68000 chip machine.</p><p>Simply put, NeXTSTEP was awesome for many years and nothing could touch it. That remains true today after NeXTSTEP's transformation into macOS.</p><p>During <em>Quake's</em>&nbsp;development, John Carmack started thinking about what might be better than NeXTSTEP. The idea of the entire development team working inside the same machine seemed pretty interesting. The machine would be insanely fast, so it would have to be a supercomputer for all of us to work on it at once. That means it would be able to crunch whatever crazy data we needed to create our upcoming worlds.</p><p>John decided that a Cray 6400 series supercomputer would be pretty cool to check out and see if we could all move over to it. Each person would have a hardware interface board that had keyboard and mouse inputs with video output on it. We would route all the cables to our desks and all be working together inside a Cray supercomputer.</p>

<p>We started getting pretty excited about the idea, so Jay Wilbur contacted Cray to see about getting a deal on a 6400. Jay got them to agree to sell us one for $500k if we put Cray supercomputers inside <em>Quake</em>, somewhere in the environment, possibly all over the place if it made sense.</p><p>John and I were all for this idea, so we said, "Let's do this." and I started experimenting with how a C-shaped Cray would look inside <em>Quake</em>. How it needed to be lit. How big it should be. What kind of textures we should use. Where it would go, and why it would be there.</p><p>I thought that powering the slipgates would probably require a supercomputer. So I should probably have a Cray connected to every slipgate, since the military-themed areas are supposed to be modern day settings.</p><p>After getting settled on the idea, and thinking the Crays would only be in select areas, disaster struck.</p><p>Cray was bought by SGI, Silicon Graphics, Inc., in February 1996.</p><p>All pending deals were canceled; our supercomputer dream crushed.</p><p>I changed the <em>Quake</em>&nbsp;slipgates to be smaller and simpler than the Cray-powered versions. As an homage to the Cray Dream we had, I put a roomful of computers in my only deathmatch map,&nbsp;<em>The Abandoned Base</em>, DM3.</p><p>Shortly after I released <em>Quake</em>&nbsp;on June 22, 1996, John decided that developing on Windows NT 3.1 was the way to go. His first project was porting <em>QuakeEd</em>&nbsp;over to Win32. I left id on August 6, 1996.</p>

<p>Heeeeeeere's Johnny!</p><p>It was dark in my office in 1995, warm, and I was busy programming <em>QuakeEd</em>. I had my stereo playing Great White, Ratt, George Lynch and all other manner of hair metal. I was in my element -&nbsp;<em>in the zone</em>.</p><p>At some point, I needed to go to the bathroom. I went to my door, turned the knob, and nothing. The door wouldn't open, the knob turning and turning. I was thinking, "Seriously?" The building materials were not grade-A, apparently, at our building in Mesquite, Texas.</p><p>I needed to get out, the pressure now mounting. I called John Carmack on his phone extension, 13.</p><p>"Dude, I'm stuck in my office. My doorknob doesn't work anymore. I think you should chop down this shitty door."</p><p>"I'll be right over."</p><p>I heard a noise on the wall, which had to be John getting his $5,000 custom axe off its mount. He walked in front of my door and tried the knob. Sure enough, the knob doomed the door to a swift death. John was telling the others in the office nearby that he was about to rescue me from my new prison.</p><p>Good thing I decided to stand with my back against the same wall as the door.</p><p><em>BAM!</em>&nbsp;The first swing came through the center of the door, just a little, and sprayed wood fragments across the room, bouncing off the opposite wall.</p><p><em>BAM!</em>&nbsp;More wood, splintering and flying. I would have been injured if I were standing in the middle of my room.</p><p>After about twelve good swings, the center of the door was completely obliterated, and I could climb through easily. I ran to the bathroom as everyone was laughing about the violence that just took place.</p><p>When I got back, I got the doorknob off and swung the door fully open. Later on, we tapped the hinges out and put the door in the storage room. A new door appeared the next day.</p><p>The story about the axe attack got around. Magazine journos that came by for interviews wanted to see the door that Carmack destroyed. We showed them. We took pictures with the door, some of which were published. The ruined door became an iconic item almost as venerable as the <em>DOOM</em>&nbsp;chainsaw.</p><p>Alas, no one at id thought the door that important, and it was taken to the scrapheap during our office remodel of 1996.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>GameTales: The Bilestoad</title><category>gametales</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2010 17:17:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/gametales-the-bilestoad</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566da810cbced62f3792488a</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>We were in <em>Quake</em>&nbsp;development. It was at the beginning when things were going smoothly, not the last seven months that turned work into a very dark place (from December 1995 on). But, I digress.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abrash">Michael Abrash</a>, the legendary programmer, was working at id and occupying the space where Tom Hall, followed by Sandy Petersen, resided - out in the open in the black id cube building in Mesquite, Texas.

<p>Ken and Michael were talking about old games. Little-known to many, Michael Abrash co-programmed the PC game,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/pc-booter/snack-attack-ii"><em>Snack Attack II</em></a>, with his friend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,207/">Dan Illowsky</a>, who was already a well-known Apple <em>II</em>&nbsp;programmer due to <em>Snack Attack's</em>&nbsp;popularity as a great Pac-Man clone.</p><p>Michael was talking about <em>Snack Attack II</em>, published in 1982, and Ken said, "Oh, we're gonna start bringing up old games, eh?" Of course, anyone talking about old games has my interest, so I came out of my office and exclaimed surprise at learning that Michael had programmed <em>Snack Attack II</em>&nbsp;with the added surprise that I had no idea there was a sequel to the Apple <em>II</em>&nbsp;version!</p><p>Ken then mentioned the old <em>Ultimas,</em>&nbsp;and I replied that I had played all of them and beaten 1 through 5 (<em>Ultima 8</em>&nbsp;had been released the year before, in 1994). I told Ken, "Look, pulling out <em>Ultima</em>&nbsp;as an old game to impress me doesn't work because it's too big and popular. Everyone knows about Ultima. Have you ever heard of <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/apple2/tarturian">The Tarturian</a></em>? Now that's a rare game!"</p><p>Ken hadn't heard of <em>The Tarturian</em>, so I told him a little bit about it. I said I had a metric ton of Apple <em>II</em>&nbsp;games and knew them all very well. Then, the following exchange happened:</p><p>Ken: "You know, I'd be really impressed if you had <em><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bilestoad">The Bilestoad</a></em>."</p><p>Me: "I have it."</p><p>Ken: "I mean the original retail version."</p><p>Me: "I have the original 1982 gold label retail floppy."</p><p>Ken: "Seriously? I'd be really impressed if you had it <em>here</em>."</p><p>Me: "I do. In fact, I am going to blow you away. Right now, in my office,&nbsp;<em>The Bilestoad</em>&nbsp;is currently running on my Apple <em>IIe</em>."</p><p>Ken: "Seriously? Holy shit, I gotta see this!"</p><p>Ken follows me into my office, and on my original computer desk from 1985, was my Apple <em>IIe</em>&nbsp;with <em>The Bilestoad </em>running in demo mode - silicon knights hacking away at each other with digital axes, replete with pixelated blood spilling on the green field.</p><p>Ken: "Now <em>that</em>&nbsp;is impressive."</p><p>Food for thought: Why did I have my Apple <em>IIe</em>&nbsp;running that day, and why did I put in <em>The Bilestoad</em>&nbsp;and leave it running in demo mode? Ken is the one who brought the game up, not me.</p><p>My life is full of seemingly impossible coincidences.</p><h3>History Lesson:</h3><p>The Bilestoad was Marc Goodman's hack-em-up Apple II action game that became a classic because of its violence and bloodshed. The game was so controversial that Marc used a nom de plume, Mangrove Earthshoe, so he could continue publishing games under his name free of stigma due to The Bilestoad. Unfortunately, this was his last game.</p><p>It's hard to detect, but Marc was attempting to play the song "Fur Elise" while simultaneously running a game. On the Apple II, this was one of the most difficult programming tasks, and very few programmers got it working right. The absolute master of this technique was Jim Nitchals, triumphantly displayed in his 1982 game Microwave.</p><p>There's an excellent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GOODMAN.HTM">interview that James Hague did with Marc Goodman here</a>.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Subnodule Gone Live</title><category>history</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2010 17:33:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/subnodule-gone-live</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566dabe2d82d5ed309b43931</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>I spent some time last weekend and created the entry for my game,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://planetromero.com/?page_id=1788">Subnodule</a></em>. I've received some emails recently asking me about more information concerning its development. The resulting article is a template for how I plan to address each of my games - there are lots of links, music, pictures, and as much recollection about the game's development as I could dredge up.</p><p>The Games link at the top of my pages will take you to the list of games with which I'm credited. There are other game links there you should check out as well.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>A Second Look: A New Series</title><category>history</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2010 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/a-second-look-a-new-series</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566db24e40667a1cc17609b2</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Upcoming - "A Second Look" is a new series of posts that offers perspectives on a range of media which has, for one reason or another, caused me to take a second look.

<p><em>The Secret of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 2)&nbsp;</em>is a game well-liked by many, and it has an overall aura of positivity around it. The soundtrack by Hiroki Kikuta is amazing and legendary, just read the wonderful review over at Chudah's Corner [ED NOTE: Site is gone forever!].</p>

<p>I can still vividly remember the first time I saw the game. Somehow, I was already excited about it before it was released. Maybe it was because I was waiting for a <em>Zelda</em>-like game on the SNES from Square (that was one of the team's important design decisions - to make a <em>Zelda</em>-like action RPG), or maybe it was the already great reviews of <em>Final Fantasy 6</em>. Square was a company to watch.</p><p>I put the SNES cartridge in, and for the first time, I heard <em>Angel's Fear</em>. Back then, this caliber of music was rare. The song portended quality and an experience not to be missed. Then, as the opening lines appeared with white swans flying across the screen, I saw the credits begin......&nbsp;<em>PROGRAMMED BY NASIR</em>.</p><p>That stopped me.</p><p>For so long, I wondered what had become of my game programming hero, Nasir Gebelli. I didn't know that he had moved to Japan in 1986 to program the <em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;games, and that he almost single-handedly saved Square from extinction. I didn't know how many games he made at Square before <em>Final Fantasy I</em>. This was the first evidence I had that he was alive and well and still making games.</p><p>Jumping into the game, I immediately noticed the innovative ring menu system. Everything was crisply programmed, Nasir-fast, and the graphics were at the height of SNES quality. They would be bettered in subsequent years by only a few games,&nbsp;<em>Seiken Densetsu 3, Final Fantasy 6 </em>and<em>&nbsp;Chrono Trigger </em>among them. So far, everything was what I had hoped for.</p><p>I started playing the game and loved having two players able to co-op. I played until I was distracted by something else. I came back later and played some more, but I didn't get very far. Years pass.</p>

<p>Eventually, I started playing the game again and made a conscious decision to start at the beginning since it had been a while since my last play. Again, the same thing happened - after a while, I got side-tracked and eventually stopped playing. I even gave it another shot after a few more years had passed with the same result.</p><p>Why wasn't I able to finish this game?</p><p>I had to think about this for a bit. It most definitely wasn't the music, because that part was great. The ring menu wasn't laborious either. So, no user interface issues for me. I did have some difficulty getting through the castle, because the werewolves moved very quickly and dealt harsh damage. But, the final time I played, I did get past that part.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1450029057703_52572">No, I finally figured that the game just wasn't that engaging.&nbsp;It didn't feel cohesive; it didn't flow like a game of high quality does. High quality design never has the player wondering what they should do next - they should already know the next step. They should not wander aimlessly in the world with everything inactive except the one object they need to click on. The reason the game felt this way, I suspect, was because the game was originally developed for a Super Nintendo CD system that Sony was developing for Nintendo. When the deal went south and Nintendo decided not to release a CD add-on for the SNES, Square had to make the game fit on a cartridge.

<p>I listen to game music. A lot. This is a recent trend circa 1995 with Chrono Trigger on the Super Nintendo. Well, it's even earlier if you count the one time I finished Karateka in 1985 and let the music at the end of the game (scored by Jordan's Dad, Francis) loop for hours as I recorded it on a tape player. But CD quality audio-wise, Chrono Trigger was the first game that demanded more attention. It was <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/YasunoriMitsuda">Yasunori Mitsuda's</a>&nbsp;first game composing job and it was pure magic. I still listen to that soundtrack today, interspersed with the thousands of other game songs I've collected.</p>





<p id="yui_3_17_2_23_1450031538914_5968">When you play a game you are experiencing a combination of story/design, interaction and audio. The audio is a very important part of the gaming experience and I always listen to the music and sound effects because it was carefully designed into the game and frames the entire piece. After the game is over and you listen to the music outside the game, if you bother to get the soundtrack, you will remember what was happening during the game as you listen to the songs.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_23_1450031538914_5969">This is what I like about game music: it lets me remember playing the game without me having to actually pull out my SNES and find the cartridge and spend time replaying it. Listening to the full soundtrack lets you remember the whole game, not just one part of it. With a library of thousands of songs, I'm reliving many of the games I've played.</p>





<p>I also have a lot of music from games I've never played and after listening to them for so long, I feel as if I know the games without having played them. For example, I've played Secret of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 2) and listen to all its music and remember the parts I played and it's great. I also have the soundtrack to Seiken Densetsu 3, never released in the USA, and the music is similar in a way, but very different. And through the music I get a very good sense of the kind of game that it is.</p><p>Remixes take game music to a whole new level. The Zelda, Super Mario, Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger series have some of the most remixed songs. The styles these songs are remixed in vary from 70's disco to jazz to orchestral to just plain crazy and creative. Best of all, you can get most game remixes for free from OCREMIX.ORG. Remixers have gotten so good at remaking these songs that they also create their own originals and recently have been scoring the soundtracks to new games such as Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD. The industry is waking up to a whole new world of talent - game music remixers. Back in 2005 when I started working on my MMO, I wanted to have remixers as composers for my game. Quinn Fox has already delivered some great stuff.</p>





<p id="yui_3_17_2_3_1450029850386_11325">It's true, game music doesn't sound like anything you would hear on the radio or MTV and most people don't recognize it when they hear it. They think it's electronic music usually. But it's not - it's a special musical form that not only sounds great, but helps you to remember.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_3_1450029850386_11108">I like remembering.</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Michiru Oshima</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4/1459468999851-SNB0SK2BBEYQPNC0UM1U/romero-profile-512x.JPG?content-type=image%2Fjpeg"/><enclosure url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4/t/566db3b2841abafcc8ee9379/1450030002232/04+ICO_+Melody+in+the+Mist+-+Castle+in+the+Mist.mp3" length="4208793" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4/t/566db3b2841abafcc8ee9379/1450030002232/04+ICO_+Melody+in+the+Mist+-+Castle+in+the+Mist.mp3" length="4208793" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"/></item><item><title>Happy Birthday, Games!</title><category>history</category><category>id software</category><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2008 18:10:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/happy-birthday-games</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566db46357eb8de92a5a287d</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may have noticed i've been a little lax in my birthday announcements this month.

<p>Ok, so i downloaded the &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt; Demo off Steam and played it...and all i can say is WOW. Amazing. Everyone, go pre-order this game as it's a sure contender for Game of the Year.</p><p>Published and developed by Valve (well, really, developed by their newly-acquired studio Turtle Rock Studios in LA) and using the very beautiful and speedy Source engine, &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt; does very right what i was attempting with &lt;em&gt;Daikatana&lt;/em&gt; - going through a story with sidekicks. There have been some great decisions made with the way the &lt;em&gt;L4D&lt;/em&gt; sidekicks are handled (some learned from MMORPGs like having character names above the sidekicks and being able to run through them) and the very limited options for interacting with them because they basically do all the things you'd want them to do without telling them. In &lt;em&gt;Daikatana&lt;/em&gt;, commanding the sidekicks could become a hassle, especially when they didn't do what you told them! LOL.</p><p>Aside from &lt;em&gt;Painkiller&lt;/em&gt; being a decent attempt at &lt;em&gt;DOOM&lt;/em&gt;-for-the-21st-century, &lt;em&gt;L4D&lt;/em&gt; does the best job i've ever seen at being able to recreate the &lt;em&gt;DOOM&lt;/em&gt; atmosphere and insane action of hordes of enemies coming to destroy you. The pacing of the gameplay is perfect with lots of slow and fast sections, a lot of that determined by how observant you are to your surroundings. The AI Director system in L4D is also a major help for replaying the game over and over. I've already blasted through the entire demo twice in a couple hours and loved seeing the gameplay change the 2nd time through.</p><p>And for me the most awesome feature is the CO-OP gameplay that i've been waiting for since &lt;em&gt;Duke 3D&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; in 1996. FINALLY! The sidekick AI is already excellent but playing CO-OP online is going to really make this game stand out. In the demo you can check it out - it's really cool.</p><p>I also wanted to close with a quick note about &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; - if you haven't played this short game, you absolutely need to. It's a breath of fresh air in the FPS genre and tells a great story without actually telling it. The final level and credits are just .....wow. You have to play this game. Even when you're finished, there's more to do with Advanced Maps and Challenge Maps. Made me feel the same way after finishing &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; and unlocking a bunch of new content that felt like the dev team really put a lot of love into their game.</p><p>Oh, and &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/em&gt; are tons of fun as well. Ok so now you know all the games i've been playing LOL.</p><p>NOVEMBER 13th!!!!!!! :D</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Rest of the World: Vote!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2008 17:22:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/rest-of-the-world-vote</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566db74c0ab377dc3ac3b02e</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

You can read more about this issue on the net but basically people are getting the Black Screen of Death when installing iPhone Apps or they are not able to run their App Store apps anymore due to the account splitting.</p><p>I had the issue with my Apps not running anymore a few days ago. To fix it, I connected my iPhone to iTunes through my computer, uninstalled all the Apps through iTunes, then reinstalled them all through iTunes. It took a while but it worked.</p><p>I've had my iPhone crash during App installs and have gotten the Black Screen of Death three times now. Here are a few hints for avoiding the BSoD until a firmware update fixes this:</p><p>(1) Do not install more than one App update at a time<br />(2) When installing an App, do not use the iPhone until it's finished installing</p><p>I've since followed these steps and have not gotten the BSoD anymore. One nice side effect from installing one App at a time is that the new App fills the hole in the icon grid left by the previously updated App. When you Install All, the iPhone will put all the new icons at the end of your icon pages, leaving behind gaping icon holes.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Stormwind: Misaligned For Years</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2008 17:32:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/13/stormwind-misaligned-for-years</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566db9a3a128e652f03f938c</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>World of Warcraft is coming up on its 4th anniversary in November and one of the biggest texture alignment issues I've experienced in any game has still gone unfixed.</p><p>This is the entrance to Stormwind. These wooden beams appear in other areas of the game -properly aligned. How can a texture misalignment of this magnitude go unaddressed for so long?

<p>As you may well know, the country of Georgia and Russia are totally going at it right now. The body count is rising and it's a political mess. I'm not writing this post to talk politics. No, I'm going to talk about one of my favorite games of All-Time - Ghost Recon.</p><p>The original PC version of Ghost Recon was released in November 2001. The entire campaign took place in Russia with some locations being in Tblisi and Ossetia - the sites of today's turmoil. That's what sparked my interest in jumping back into the game again. And I'm so glad I did - it's truly one of the greatest games made. I can play it for hours and hours; it never gets boring. In fact, it's massively suspenseful.</p><p>Ghost Recon was the very first (and one of the very few) games where enemies in camouflage are 100% effective. You can be lying in prone position on the ground as a sniper in your ghillie suit, scoping out the area, and not spot the enemy crawling slowly toward you in full camo - it's that amazing.</p><p>It has every multiplayer option you could hope for....and I always hope for Co-Op. It has excellent support for Co-Op as well as a bunch of other modes. My favorite way to play is to just jump into a Quick Mission on Castle MP06 (daytime), make Team A be only myself as a sniper with an SP25 + Grenades and Team B be a Demolitions expert with an MM1 and a Tank Killer rocketlauncher. I like trying to take the entire place out by myself. If I get killed then I'm auto-switched to the Demo member and I just go nuts bombing the whole place until I'm taken down (it's inevitable). I start with a Team B member because I like hearing the confirmation of every kill.</p><p>After saving Moscow from the Russian rebels, the game ends. But that's not all. Red Storm released two additional add-ons: Desert Siege (2002) and Island Thunder (2002). DS took place in Africa and IT took place in Cuba. Both are just spectacular experiences. The storylines are serious and the environments and missions are sublime. In all games, the enemy AI is what totally shines - they are TOUGH. You'll know what I mean if you try to play a map by yourself with no backup. Crazy suspense and totally FUN.</p><p>You can buy all of this in one big Ghost Recon Gold box for about $20. It's so worth it. The graphics look dated by today's standards but it's the gameplay that will live forever. It's DirectX so it works great on everything. I play it on Vista with no issues. Performance is top-of-the-line as the game is 7 years old. Go pick it up - you'll love it.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Wolf3D = 16</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2008 19:29:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/14/wolf3d-16</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566f2689d8af10aa5eaba207</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>So here I sit, typing this update on my MacBook, an amazing Apple product, writing about a game I worked on 16 years ago which just happened to be a mere 3 years after I stopped writing for my first Apple love, the Apple II platform. It's been a long time between heavy use of Apple products but now is the time for me to fully switch back into Apple mode. I'm already addicted to my iPhone, Apple TV and MacBook. Next up: iMac and Mac Pro and I'm off and away - goodbye Microsoft.</p><p>I just figured I'd announce my switch on Wolfy's birthday. The relevance? Wolfenstein 3D was a game lovingly crafted by 4 guys, 3 of which were longtime Apple II fanatics and coders; a game that was based on one of our all-time favorite Apple II games, Castle Wolfenstein. So you see, it all comes back around to Apple one way or another.</p><p>(To see something Wolfy made with Legos,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mocpages.com/moc.php/17215">check this out</a>)</p><p>Update: I just saw that SxePhil on YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldID_F0krjU">said happy birthday to Wolf3D</a>!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Amazing Iron Man</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2008 19:34:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/14/the-amazing-iron-man</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566f27b60ab377563c2d3e24</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>Yesterday we bought a time slot at the nearby San Mateo AMC for the entire company to watch Ironman at 4pm. Everyone showed up which is usually a good sign. I loved all the previews (The Love Guru, You Don't Mess WIth The Zohan, The Hulk) and then the movie began.</p><p>It was 2 hours of amazing action, dialogue, acting and technological goodness. Robert Downey Jr. has completely vindicated himself with this movie IMO. And Jeff Bridges was, as always, bigger than life and extremely smooth even as an evil corporate Dude. The cars were awesome, the computers futuristic, the tech unbearably cool and the acting superb.</p><p>And even better, at the end of it, it's just the beginning for Ironman - the sequel will see Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury recruiting Ironman into S.H.I.E.L.D. As far as I'm concerned this is the highest quality comic brand that's seen the big screen. When I was a kid I was a Spiderman and Ironman devotee so this movie made me really happy.</p><p>Go see it!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>ActionScript 3 Class Definition and Importing Sickness</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2008 20:36:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/14/actionscript-3-class-definition-and-importing-sickness</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566f2832a976af240a81aadb</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>Sorry, but this post is about some programming garbage.<br />Okay, so i decided to write a little ActionScript 3 code since it's all object-oriented and somehow "real" compared to the previous joke versions. I was trying to create a small class that did some simple stuff and get it working in the Flash environment. After reading several examples straight from Adobe and some forums I wrote what looked like a simple, pristine piece of code that should have worked.</p><p>The error I got when I tried running the code was this:</p><blockquote><pre>1180: Call to a possibly 
undefined method xxxx
</pre></blockquote><p>This basically means that Flash couldn't find the class that I created. But I didn't get any errors from the "import" statement that references the .AS file that has the class in it (inside a package{}).</p><p>If I changed the filename I'm trying to import I get an error. Ok, so it knows the file is there but it cannot find the class inside the file for some reason.</p><p>I searched all over the net for an hour trying to find the answer to this problem. NOWHERE DID I FIND THE SOLUTION THAT I AM ABOUT TO GIVE YOU. The solution to the problem is something that, evidently, Flash programmers JUST KNOW from experience but the solution isn't written anywhere that I could find on the internet and my Flash coders don't know how they know the technicality I'm about to explain.</p><p>So it comes down to this: the way you write the name of your class MUST be the EXACT way you name the .AS file it's in.</p><p>For example: if I create a class named BugJar like so:</p><blockquote><p>package<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; public class BugJar<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //...code...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />}</p></blockquote><p>then I **MUST** save it in a file named BugJar.as!!!!</p><p>Inside my framecode I would have:</p><blockquote><p>import BugJar;</p></blockquote><p>...and it would work.</p><p>This is just completely disgusting to me as a programmer. Linking the name of a class to the filename of the file it's in is just wrong.</p><p>What's worse is that Flash doesn't even give you the proper error for this:</p><p>filename: bugjar.as</p><blockquote><p>package<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; public class BugJar<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //...code...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />}</p></blockquote><p>framecode:</p><blockquote><p>import bugjar;<br />var jar:BugJar = new BugJar();</p></blockquote><p>The above example WILL NOT WORK and Flash doesn't give you an error message that helps you understand or fix this problem that shouldn't exist in the first place.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Blue Oyster Cult Loves Star Blazer?</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2008 20:42:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/14/blue-oyster-cult-loves-star-blazer</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:566f2956e0327c809b3649a8</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I was watching some of my favorite Blue Oyster Cult vids on YouTube and when I started up "Take Me Away" I was amazed to see someone playing Tony Suzuki's Star Blazer on a green-screen Apple ][!

<p>I decided to delete the hoopla regarding Mike Wilson because, really, there was no need to dwell on anything other than the important part—that Mike is helping some great games get out there. No matter the past, the bottom line is I sincerely wish Mike real success on this opportunity and know that he’s capable of it.</p><p>For my part, I’m looking forward to playing the games that his developer network is creating at this moment. I’m familiar with some of the guys running studios he's publishing and I can say without exaggeration that they are extremely skilled individuals. I, and all of us in the industry, should hope the best for them. Indies rule!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Korgoth!

<p>Just saw the movie and I can't even describe how awesome..... just..... wow. Totally blown away. I'm a major fan of monster movies and this was totally unexpected.</p><p>I knew it was shaky cam and all so be prepared for that if you go see it. You get used to it pretty quickly. I love the fact that all the actors are total unknowns and the entire movie is told from one character's point of view. You have no idea why the monster is there, where it came from or anything else - the characters don't dwell on watching TV and the military has no answers either.</p><p>So it's the most realistic portrayal of what it would probably be like if a creature was rampaging through New York. We were totally blown away by it and need to go watch it again.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Major Apple Love</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2008 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/major-apple-love</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5671522e40667ae64c684523</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>These days it's hard not to notice just how awesome Apple has become. Sure, you pay a premium price but you enjoy the best of the best with an aesthetic quality unmatched by even their most sincere imitators.</p><p>I've been an Apple guy since 1979 and devoted 10 years of my life to the 6502 nestled deep within the Apple II series. I admired the Mac but wasn't a Mac nut until the latest OS release, Leopard. And now the Mac just simply rocks.</p><p>It started with the iPhone I got back in June. Coolest device I've ever owned and it's still the best. Frequent firmware upgrades make me really happy. Because of the phone I went out and got a MacBook laptop with Leopard installed so I could see if Mac OS X with all of NeXTSTEP's awesomeness inside it was really all I was hoping it would be. And wow, was I blown away.</p><p>Until you've used a computer where the OS was written FOR the specific hardware you just don't know what you're missing. The world of the PC is based on the reality that everyone's computer is different and requires special drivers to make it work right - but only with that one device. The Mac is different - it's designed to work together as a whole and you can really tell the difference. Even the pixelicious scrolling in Safari is enough to show you how smoooooth the experience is.</p><p>So, in love with the MacBook, I went out and got an Apple TV since I had tired of the buggy-ass D-Link streaming video box I have (and the garbage one before it). And again I was totally amazed at how awesome and easy this device turned out. I'm a total iTunes devotee so the Apple TV just worked exactly as I had hoped. Better in fact.</p><p>And now MacWorld 2008 has shown promise that Apple's long awaited rise to prominence has begun. I'm excited about the future of Apple again.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Duke Nukem Forever Screenshot!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2007 12:03:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/duke-nukem-forever-screenshot</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:567152c8a976af3e2f3d4848</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>We all knew the day would come - the eventual release of Duke Nukem Forever.

<p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3673">And tomorrow at noon, Texas time, they will be releasing the first teaser trailer for the game!!!</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3716">I, for one, cannot wait for the Duke to rise again. It's been a looooong time but it's better to be late and super great than punctual and barely functional.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3717">UPDATE: The <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.primotechnology.com/video/1207/DNF_Teaser_720p_HD.mov" href="http://www.primotechnology.com/video/1207/DNF_Teaser_720p_HD.mov">teaser is out</a>&nbsp;and I love it! (right-click, save as) The Duke is back and I'm going to like it no matter what.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3718">My own observations and thoughts from the teaser:</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3719">(1) Love the Terminator hammering going on while the scenes fly by. Ominously badass.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3720">(2) The redone Duke theme song sounds a little overworked for me. Heavier power chords like the original would sound harder if run through a Pantera-style GSP (Dimebag's sound ruled).</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3721">(3) Totally love the American flag at the end - Duke is All-American FTW!</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3722">(4) I love the quote at the end, "I'm looking for some alien toilet to park my bricks, who's first?" The reason is because it portends more sophisticated one-liners than you'd expect. I loved D3D's lines immensely but seeing a slight evolution in style was very nice.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3723">(5) The tech is great, the graphics (textures, anims, etc.) are great. If the gameplay holds true to the original in that there's intense FPS fighting and tons of interactivity with the environment then I'm predicting huge success. One huge reason Half-Life 2 did so well was that they stuck with their incredible formula from HL1 and it continues to work.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_4_1450216261963_3724">My thought is that the very interactive nature of D3D's environment was one of the defining elements of Duke's IP and that continuing to include that kind of interactivity with the environment will further cement Duke's IP and heighten the probability of DNF's success. That and the over-the-top Duke attitude and humor make for one of the most engaging character-driven FPS's to come along in.....oh, about 12 years (come February 2008).</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Happy 17th Birthday Keen!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2007 12:06:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/happy-17th-birthday-keen</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:56715338b204d5066012657f</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>As if DOOM wasn't old enough to make me feel my age now it's Commander Keen's birthday and I'm REALLY feelin' it. Today I'll just do a combo birthday announcement for the 1st and 2nd Keen trilogies (1-3 and 4-6) since Keen 4-6 was released on December 15th, 1991 and will be 16 years old. They're like big, old babies! LOL.</p><p>If you'd like to remember Keen or if you've never heard of it, check out some of these sites:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.3drealms.com/keenhistory/">Keen History</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.3drealms.com/keen1/">Official Keen Site</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.3drealms.com/keen4/">Another Official Keen Site</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.commander-keen.com/">Commander Keen fan site</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen">Wikipedia entry</a></p><p>Back when Keen was released it was a sensation because no one had played a smooth Mario-style game on a PC before. I have a big box full of the letters from parents who wrote in ordering the game along with lots of praise - at that point we felt we were on the right track. And it all started with this little fella!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Yay!

<p>It's that time of year again; time to raise a toast to the venerable DOOM. Blue's News has a nice comment about DOOM. Also, check out DoomWorld for the official site celebration.</p><p>I don't really have anything new to say except that working on DOOM was still one of the true highlights of my gaming career. Until you actually work on something as tremendous and magical as DOOM you have no idea what that feeling is like. We totally knew we were making something really special and beyond our previous games which in themselves were groundbreaking as well (Commander Keen; Wolfenstein 3D). I was fortunate enough to experience all that with my friends at id and it was truly awesome.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2girls1cup dot com</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2007 12:16:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/2girls1cup-dot-com</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:56715614cbced6a949fb810c</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>When you first start coding in C/C++ your first programs are done in the console. The problem with the console nowadays is that the conio.h library no longer lets you do all the fun things it used to, like set the text color, set cursor position, clear the screen, etc. You can only print text out in a stream just like the olden days of the 70's and teletype printers. Lame.</p><p>This is the problem that all beginning game coders run into and it really takes some of the fun out of learning when you can't even sit down and try to write Pac-Man in text mode.</p><p>So I poked around and found a little snippet of code, added my own functions and now I have a nice little text console library you can use. Just add the console.h and console.cpp files into your empty Win32 console project and you can actually make text games. Without this kind of library you can't really make any kind of fun text game other than an adventure.</p><p>I threw together a short sample program to demonstrate what you can do. It's a simple maze that has a random exit ('X') in it; touch it and you win. The source is named main.cpp. The game? ULTRA-X OF THE FORBIDDEN REALM!</p><p>To add even cooler stuff to your console games you should download FMOD and link it into your project. Instructions on how to do this are on <a href="http://fmod.org">FMOD.ORG</a>&nbsp;and are easy to follow. Imagine that - a text game with background music and sound effects.</p><p><a href="http://planetromero.com/rome.ro/media/console_lib.zip">Grab the code here</a>&nbsp;(Windows only)</p>]]></description></item><item><title>R.I.P.

<p>One of my favorite writers and game authors from the 80's was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Anderson">John J. Anderson</a>. I first got acquainted with John from his excellent game Sea Dragon (published by Scott Adam's company <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/company/adventure-international">Adventure International</a>) and then Eliminator.</p><p>I used to read his columns in Creative Computing magazine and he was a very bright guy, crossing over between the Apple II and Atari 800 with ease. He was one of the few authors back in the day to write code for both platforms because it required quite a bit of knowledge to do both well. Not only did you have to be completely fluent with 6502 assembler but you also had to know the entire memory map of the system and all the important switches and places in RAM and ROM. John was a master of 8-bit systems alongside Jim Nitchals and David Lubar.</p><p>John Anderson died on October 17, 1989, seventeen years ago. R.I.P. John.</p><p>AWESOME UPDATE: Evidently, the John Anderson who died in this news article was NOT the game programmer, but the journalist. The game programming John Anderson contacted me and said he's quite alive still.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Fracas Reveal</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2007 12:32:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/the-fracas-reveal</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:567167cb0ab3776ddb7fc0d6</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>Some of you may have noticed one of the random messages along the top has been "Stuart Smith, where are you?" I am, of course, referring to the author of the great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/adventure-construction-set">Adventure Construction Set</a>&nbsp;and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/ali-baba-and-the-forty-thieves">Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</a>&nbsp;from Quality Software.</p><p>One of my small hobbies is locating lost greats from the dawn of the game industry with most of my focus on the Apple II authors.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,9286/">Stuart Smith</a>&nbsp;is one of those lost authors I have yet to find.</p><p>One of the earliest and probably first-published titles Stuart worked on was Fracas, a lo-res turn-based RPG that could eat up a LOT of hours. I recently ran the game again and remembered that it was written in Applesoft Basic, a language that I'm very familar with.</p><p>While scrolling through the game listing (this is a game from 1980, mind you) I immediately noticed the line:</p><p>5 DEF FN RN(I) = INT( RND(1)* I )</p><p>and I thought "oh yeah, I never did figure out what the hell that DEF FN keyword was used for." Then I resolved to learn what it actually did so I looked up an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple2.org/faq/FAQ.applesoft18.html">Applesoft reference manual</a>&nbsp;and found out.</p><p>Wow. I cannot believe I never learned the value of DEF FN and the countless times I could have used it in my games! It's really simple: you are defining a function that you can call without a GOSUB and it can take a parameter. Basically an inline function.....in Applesoft Basic!</p><p>Amazing. And to think that I learned this from a game written at the dawn of the PC gaming age.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Doom Archaeology</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jun 2007 12:33:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/doom-archaeology</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:567168340ab3776ddb7fc3bb</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>I've been doing some digging around in the original Doom development directory since I'm working on consolidating all my data in a sane arrangement. The Doom source that was released years ago wasn't the nice raw development directory otherwise you would have all seen the NeXTSTEP DoomEd source, Doom map source files, and what I have here: unreleased Doom MIDI files.</p><p>There's a reason these weren't released - they're not very good, at least not as great as the music we actually shipped with the game. Some of the songs are just repetitive riffs. All the songs are named unXX.mid where XX is a number.</p><p>Some of the standout tracks are:</p><p>opening: this was an idea for the original Doom title screen song.<br />un17: Would have actually fit in the game.<br />un30: I like it's funkiness. Reminds me of Wolfy.<br />un36: I hated this song. I assigned it to e3m6 originally and everytime I ran that level I just cringed. I eventually removed it.<br />un39: Would have been a cool intermission screen.<br />un52: A better version of this song was in the game.</p><p>I think a few of the songs are early versions of some that were in the game. So for any of your Bobby Prince fans out there, here's more of the man's work.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://rome.ro/s/doom_unreleased_music.zip">Get it here</a></p>]]></description><itunes:author>Bobby Prince</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4/1459468999851-SNB0SK2BBEYQPNC0UM1U/romero-profile-512x.JPG?content-type=image%2Fjpeg"/><enclosure url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4/t/5671ae001c1210b2393f5fe3/1450290688982/opening.mp3" length="847008" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4/t/5671ae001c1210b2393f5fe3/1450290688982/opening.mp3" length="847008" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"/></item><item><title>Nasir Gebelli Interview Clip</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2007 13:16:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2016/1/11/nasir-gebelli-interview-clip</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5693b77ca128e6b30eb62c40</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>August 8, 1998 was a night to remember. I hosted an Apple II Reunion and invited many Apple II pioneers and it was quite a turnout: over 40 legends showed up along with many game industry folks and the atmosphere was electric.</p><p>In one area you had Steve Wozniak talking about the Apple II hardware, in the conference room you had stacks of old computer magazines and Apple II's being signed by pioneers, in the game room everyone was mingling and talking about the old days while upstairs Steve Kent and I were busy interviewing some of these people on video for posterity.</p><p>I plan to make a DVD of this event but for now here is a short clip of an interview with Nasir Gebelli - one of the people that everyone was dying to meet at the party. For those of you who don't know, Nasir co-founded Sirius Software, what I call the "id Software of the early 80's". Nasir also programmed Final Fantasy 1,2,3 on the NES and then Secret of Mana. He's completely awesome.</p><p>I have a poster of Nasir in my office and you can print one yourself from my photo gallery (poster section). You can watch the video here:</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1452521849065_3595">Nasir has a lot of Japanese fans who will probably be happy to see this video.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1452521849065_3402">A quick note about the video: there's a point where an observer asks Nasir a question about how he felt about Mark Turmell regarding him as a game god at the party. What this person probably didn't know is that Mark Turmell's games were published by Nasir's company Sirius Software. Yes, Nasir was The Daddy way back when Mark got into the industry. And if you didn't know, Mark is still going strong at Midway in Chicago</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Family Feud Hilarity</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2007 12:57:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/f5m9si02w5voewq35x7ugbtjgq0ek2</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5671ba9da976af15879f1796</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I used to love this show.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Guitar Joke</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2007 18:31:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/guitar-joke</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5671bbae1115e0e81740c98a</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>I love the Guitar Hero games. It's the game I think I had been waiting for my entire life. I grew up in the Metal 80's and fully immersed myself so much so that when I recently heard about the latest installment in the Guitar Hero franchise being all about 80's guitar, well, to me it seemed extremely obvious: HEAVY METAL!</p><p>Imagine my disappointment (and many of you out there as well) when I read the initial tracklist and found jokes such as Flock of Seagulls, Police, Bow Wow Wow, Asia, Billy Squier, etc. I was actually really pissed. Here was a golden opportunity to showcase what I really believe should have been on the original Guitar Hero game in the first place. What happened? They played a big joke on me.</p><p>First of all, the press release mentioned "from the classic era". Uh, guys, that was in the 70's. All of which I very much respect given that I'm a huge Sabbath, Priest, Santana, Scorpions, Rainbow, etc. fan myself. Second, they list 7 initially confirmed songs that are supposed to allow me to "experience the ultimate rock star fantasy". Sorry guys, but pretending to be the guitarist of The Police (whoever the hell he was) or Faster Pussycat (and who is he? Barely anyone knows. Or cares.) just isn't anywhere in the solar system of guitarists I'd like to be. Red Octane already gave me some of those guys in the original Guitar Hero with Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix, Dimebag Darrell, Tom Scholz and Jake E. Lee. Hell, even Dimebag contributed to a video game in his own special way (see if any of you can track that one down). But with Activision involved it's like someone brought a strap up against the nuts of the franchise.</p><p>Also, many of the songs listed thus far just are not what I'd call songs that I want to play on a guitar that make me feel cool. I will say that "Holy Diver" and "Round And Round" *are* songs I'm very happy with on that list. But that's only 2 out of the 14 known so far (wikipedia has a more extensive list than the press release). There's supposed to be 30 ass-kicking songs. So half of them produce only 2 that I like. I was expecting this "Rocks the 80's" to be badass metal, mostly melodic and not thrashy because that's just not fun to play. Okay, Nuno Bettencourt is in there, which adds a little cred.</p><p>If I was putting together an 80's Metal version of Guitar Hero here's what I'd put together. I thought about these a lot, they're not the typical songs you'd expect (for example, no damn Paranoid, War Pigs, Iron Man from Black Sabbath) and they're really kickass and definitely songs that I wish I could play on a stage in front of millions. Okay, not all of these songs are 80's Metal but most of them are. The ones that aren't are just awesome and should have been on Guitar Hero 1:</p><p>EASY:</p><p>Accept - Up To The Limit (great riff)<br />Black Sabbath - Nightwing<br />Crimson Glory - Heart of Steel<br />David Lee Roth - Big Trouble (Steve Vai!)<br />Deep Purple - Perfect Strangers<br />Def Leppard - Foolin<br />Dio - When A Woman Cries<br />Dokken - Unchain The Night<br />Firehouse - All She Wrote<br />Great White - Shot In The Dark<br />Helix - Heavy Metal Love<br />Judas Priest - A Touch Of Evil<br />Judas Priest - Turning Circles (70's classic)<br />Kingdom Come - Who Do You Love?<br />Kingdom Come - Perfect O<br />Kingdom Come - Living Out Of Touch (great riff)<br />Kiss - Love Gun (70's classic)<br />Motley Crue - Looks That Kill<br />Ozzy Osbourne - Hellraiser<br />Queensryche - The Lady Wore Black<br />Rainbow - Stone Cold (70's classic)<br />Scorpions - Hold Me Tight<br />Scorpions - In Trance<br />Slaughter - Up All Night<br />Van Halen - Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love (70's classic)<br />W.A.S.P. - Restless Gypsy<br />Winger - Spell I'm Under</p><p>MEDIUM:</p><p>Accept - Teach Us To Survive<br />Alice Cooper - Step On You<br />Black Label Society - S.D.M.F.<br />Black Sabbath - Headless Cross<br />Bulletboys - Hard As A Rock<br />Cinderella - Long Cold Winter<br />Crimson Glory - Dragon Lady<br />Def Leppard - Photograph<br />Dio - Dream Evil<br />Dokken - Seven Thunders<br />Firehouse - Reach For The Sky<br />Great White - House Of Broken Love<br />Great White - Lady Red Light<br />Great White - Step On You<br />Iron Maiden - Flight Of Icarus<br />Judas Priest - Nightcrawler<br />Loudness - Crazy Nights<br />Motley Crue - Knock Em Dead Kid<br />Ozzy Osbourne - Flying High Again<br />Psychotic Waltz - Into The Everflow<br />REO Speedwagon - Roll With The Changes (70's classic)<br />Savatage - Sirens<br />Saxon - Beyond The Grave<br />Saxon - Lionheart<br />Scorpions - You Give Me All I Need<br />Scorpions - Don't Believe Her<br />Scorpions - Rock You Like A Hurricane<br />Steelheart - Can't Stop Me Lovin' You<br />Steelheart - Everybody Loves Eileen<br />TNT - Everyone's A Star<br />Vinnie Vincent - Ashes To Ashes<br />W.A.S.P. - Charisma<br />Warrant - Uncle Tom's Cabin<br />Whitesnake - Fool For Your Lovin'<br />Winger - Hangin' On<br />Winger - Hungry<br />Yngwie Malmsteen - Queen In Love</p><p>HARD:</p><p>Black Label Society - Funeral Bell<br />Black Sabbath - Digital Bitch<br />Bulletboys - Hell Yeah!<br />Crimson Glory - In Dark Places<br />Dokken - Kiss Of Death<br />Dokken - Sleepless Night<br />Dokken - Mr. Scary<br />Dokken - Sunless Days<br />Dokken - Don't Close Your Eyes<br />Eric Johnson - Cliffs Of Dover (pure guitar mastery)<br />Gary Moore - Oh Pretty Woman<br />Iron Maiden - Powerslave<br />Joe Satriani - Devil's Slide<br />Joe Satriani - Flying In A Blue Dream<br />Joe Satriani - If I Could Fly<br />Judas Priest - Demonizer<br />Judas Priest - Painkiller<br />Judas Priest - Hellrider<br />Judas Priest - Metal Meltdown<br />Lynch Mob - River Of Love<br />Lynch Mob - She's Evil But She's Mine<br />Ozzy Osbourne - Desire<br />Ozzy Osbourne - Fool Like You<br />Psychotic Waltz - Haze One<br />Queensryche - Eyes Of A Stranger<br />Racer X - Superheroes<br />Racer X - Viking Kong<br />Ratt - You're In Love<br />Ratt - Lay It Down<br />Savatage - Conversation Piece<br />Savatage - Strange Wings<br />Savatage - 24 Hours Ago<br />Saxon - Searching For Atlantis<br />Scorpions - Make It Real<br />Solitude Aeturnus - Spiral Descent<br />Steve Vai - Erotic Nightmares<br />TNT - Sapphire<br />White Lion - Hungry<br />White Lion - Lonely Nights<br />White Lion - Lady Of The Valley<br />Winger - Blind Revolution Mad<br />Yngwie Malmsteen - Enemy<br />Yngwie Malmsteen - Leviathan</p><p>Okay, that's a massive list but I pared my huge list of songs I love down to this. So I expect several 80's Metal compilations. Or just choose any of these from each section, group them as you like and just put it out so I can finally play these "for real"!</p><p>But please don't release the lame thing you call 80's guitar.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Billy's Balloon</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2007 18:35:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/billys-balloon</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5671bcd00ab3774b34552fda</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is my kind of humor!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Hungarian Surprise!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2007 18:37:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/whxol2b1czxjcg8alzzg871yu0izup</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5671bd350ab3774b3455347d</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>Unknown to me and maybe even id Software way back when, 12 years ago a couple Hungarian DOOM novels were written and released (bottom two books). Of course I know all about the English DOOM novels by Daffyd ab Hugh but these are a surprise to me.</p><p>Scans of these books are posted in my DOOM photo section.</p><p>The top two books comprise Masters of DOOM split up. The translation of the text is "DooM Legendája (Legend of DooM). Hogyan változtatta meg John Carmack és John Romero a világot (How did John Carmack and John Romero change the world)".</p><p>Thanks for the info, Timea Cseke (IMPgirl)!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>OGDC Interview</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2007 18:39:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/ogdc-interview</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5671bdb540667a634d0caad9</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>I was up in Seattle last week for the OGDC conference where I was on a panel discussing development of MMOs and the panel was fielding all kinds of questions. After the panel I was interviewed by Evan, whom I've known for years.</p><p>Right now, in the news section on Gamasutra is a blurb about the interview (with link).

<p>As you all know, I'm not much of an activist. I like making and playing games and being a happy consumer like you all. But sometimes you have to wake up and pay attention to what's happening in the world while we're all at home having fun playing World of Warcraft or Gears of War.</p><p>As reported on Project Censored, the world's oceans are in extreme danger (story #3) and there's very little being done to reverse the devastating warming trend that is changing everything about the planet's most vital resource.</p><p>If you can't get out there and do something directly at least you can do something in a minor way: vote for a president that will actually do something about this problem, for real. Bush is most definitely not that person, nor do I suspect, any Republican president unless I see an extreme environmental conservation strategy on the bill.</p><p>VOTE!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Slipgate Web Team</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 May 2007 18:47:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/16/slipgate-web-team</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5671bfa257eb8d614137fbd3</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p class="">It's taken a while but The EO and .petroid have done something pretty cool: they stripped Daikatana down to the smallest size possible for playing deathmatch, 114mb total download.</p><p class="">I tried it out and it worked perfectly. There's been some modification of lots of little things and it has a great little launcher included to simplify some options. I connected to a master server and found about 5 of them running and people were DMing so I joined and it was tough to stop!</p><p class="">Here is the download (Windows OS) - have fun and hope to see you in there.</p>

<p>[NOTE: I don't condone starting in C++ as a first language anymore.]</p><p>After further investigation and actual use, I would like to now recommend Michael Dawson's book "Beginning C++ Game Programming". I went to the book store, rifled through a ton of C++ programming books and after getting through my filter I settled on this book for my son Michael to start with.</p><p>Even though the title of the book sounds like you'll be getting into a bunch of fun game stuff the reality is that all the focus for the first 8 or so chapters is just on learning C. C++ comes in during the next couple chapters and builds upon what you learned about C but doesn't go too far - it keeps it simple.</p><p>Along the way you use the language to construct a few simple games that are all text-based which I believe is a great way to just focus on learning the language and some basics about game construction. So don't be expecting to be drawing graphics and making sounds and using the mouse on a graphical screen - you need another book to do that and it should be AFTER you get through this one.</p><p>I got Michael a book on coding game graphics that he's diving into now since he finished this book. I'm proud to say that he can program in C++ now after finishing this book and it's not an overly long one either. It's also very easy to understand with good explanations for the concepts.</p><p>Some things I would have liked to have seen in the book were explanations of switch() before its use, using struct{} and explanations of complex data structures, and explanations and use of printf. The book relies heavily on cout and cin which I'm not too fond of because of the syntax but they're easy to understand when it comes to printing string objects. When Michael was going through the book I taught him printf and had him convert all the couts in the book to printfs - it showed him more about what goes on inside those string objects and was less typing when he needed to print %d, %s, etc. arguments.</p><p>One important note: the gaming college Full Sail uses this book as their introductory programming course book. Michael went into Full Sail right after finishing this book so he got to do it all over again. Much easier the second time!</p><p>Try it.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Spiders On Drugs</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2007 16:36:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/17/spiders-on-drugs</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5672f261a976af1587a9a21e</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is too hilarious - totally unexpected!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>See Yuh!!!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2007 16:41:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/17/see-yuh</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5672f3abd82d5e366e76c4a8</guid><description><![CDATA[]]></description></item><item><title>Dark Forces Running on Windows Vista</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2007 16:38:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/17/dark-forces-running-on-windows-vista</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5672f2dea2bab8f9c9775cee</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>I've been a huge, huge fan of LucasArt's Dark Forces (1995) for 12 years now and after moving to Windows XP I started running into some problems getting it to run properly, especially the CD-ROM detection.</p><p>Well, I found a fansite called DF-21 that had some excellent directions on how to get Dark Forces running on Windows XP. I messed around with the directions to simplify them a little bit and figured out how to get it to run on Vista. Here are my new directions for getting Dark Forces to run on Vista WITHOUT the CD in the drive:</p><p>(1) copy entire contents of Dark Forces CD to a directory (ex. d:gamesdark). Keep the directory name to 8 letters or less.<br />(2) run DOSBox 0.65 or higher (as of this writing, 0.70 is the current version and it works great)<br />(3) mount c d:gamesdark (or wherever you put the game on your hard drive)<br />(4) c:<br />(5) subst p: c: (you can use a letter other than P: as long as it's free on your system)<br />(6) p:<br />(7) cd dark<br />(8) type either imuse or dark to run the sound config utility or the game<br />(9) press ctrl-F12 until it runs smoothly (20,000+ cycles for me). With DOSBox 0.70 I didn't need to increase the cycles - worked perfectly!</p><p>Extras:<br />When running IMUSE for the first time, choose C for custom setup, choose Sound Blaster Pro, use all the default values (220, 5, 1 ) then choose the Advanced Menu. Select Music and choose the Roland at port 330 for the best music.</p><p>The only problem I'm having is remapping the keys because evidently Dark Forces didn't come with that ability until a later release. There's some info on the net on how to modify the JEDI.CFG file with your own scancodes and supposedly there's a DF95.EXE program somewhere that does this. Sounds like I should just write this little program to get my keys remapped.</p><p>Anyway, I'm really happy to be able to play Dark Forces again under Vista without the CD in the drive at the original framerate and with full Roland audio support!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>This Shit Makes Me Laugh</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2007 17:42:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/17/this-shit-makes-me-laugh</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5672f416bfe8739f7afa8a59</guid><description><![CDATA[]]></description></item><item><title>DOOM Named as One of Ten Most Important Games</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2007 17:44:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/17/doom-named-as-one-of-ten-most-important-games</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5672f478841aba57760ee46e</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>At the 2007 GDC Henry Lowood, curator of the History of Science and Technology Collections at Stanford University, announced that DOOM is one of the 10 most important games of all time.</p><p>Mr. Lowood had a four-person committee made up of Warren Spector, Steve Meretzky, Matteo Bittanti (academic researcher) and Christopher Grant (game journalist) who decided which games out of all games that had been created since the dawn of gaming in the early 60's had the biggest impact on the game industry.</p><p>I can't even overstate how awesome it feels to have one of my games awarded this insanely lofty status. It's mind boggling.</p><p>Some people have been arguing that Wolfenstein 3D should have been mentioned in place of DOOM because it was the birth of the fast-action FPS but I disagree. If you can remember, following Wolf3D's release there were several other 3D FPS's released that had minimal impact on the industry (Ken's Labyrinth, The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki, Nerves of Steel, Escape From Monster Manor, Isle of the Dead, the Catacombs sequels, Blake Stone 1 &amp; 2, and many others). Most of these Wolf3D clones, not DOOM clones were released post-DOOM. Only Heretic has the distinction of being the first post-DOOM clone as all the other games released up to the end of 1994 were ray-cast engines laid out in a Wolf3D-style grid.</p><p>DOOM had a real impact in launching the genre beyond what Wolf3D achieved because its 3D technology rendered a world more realistic than anything yet experienced at an amazing framerate, high-speed multiplayer deathmatch was seen for the first time and we opened up our data files for the world to modify. Oh, we also gave it away for free. You only paid money if you wanted to play the rest of the series.</p><p>Quake may have launched the era of the true 3D high-speed FPS, today's world of 3D graphics adapters, internet FPS play and professional gaming, but the FPS genre really took off with DOOM.</p><p>Here's the list of all 10 games:</p><h3>Spacewar! (1962)<br />Star Raiders (1979)<br />Zork (1980)<br />Tetris (1985)<br />SimCity (1989)<br />Super Mario Bros. 3 (1990)<br />Civilization I / II (1991)<br />Doom (1993)<br />Warcraft (Series) (1994)<br />Sensible World of Soccer (1994)</h3><p>(As an aside, the New York Times article was written by Heather Chaplin, author of the book Smartbomb.)</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Sarajevo Just Got a Notch Cooler!</title><dc:creator>John Romero</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2007 17:53:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://rome.ro/news/2015/12/17/sarajevo-just-got-a-notch-cooler</link><guid isPermaLink="false">566d855a841abafcc8ed19c4:566d86c02399a3bdabbc9bdf:5672f5cc0ab3774b345f6c28</guid><description><![CDATA[<figure class="

<p>I consider myself an early adopter and I love trying out new operating systems as soon as possible. I was in the Vista beta a while back but it ran pretty bad on my old computer system (3.4ghz, GeForce 6600).</p><p>But as soon as Vista was officially released I had to get me some Ultimate. Hey, I like the black box. The signed version wasn't at Fry's when I went there, in fact, there were very few Ultimates that day.</p><p>I'll keep the story short but basically it took me an entire week to get my computer running Vista nice and stable the way it should run. And the problem was entirely the network card (D-Link Extreme N; I installed it on XP and had the same problems). I changed to a Netgear and everything went perfect, no more lockups. I went through 3 motherboards, got a huge CPU fan, etc. And it ended up being the wireless card. Sigh.</p><p>Anyway, to actually get Vista running the way it really should I had to upgrade my computer: new motherboard (Gigabyte GA-M59SLI-S5), 2 gigs of Corsair 3200c2 2-3-3-6, new CPU (AMD Athlon 64 X2 5200+; 2.6ghz x2) and a new video card (GeForce 7900 GTX). My Windows Experience Index is at 5.2 (CPU being the lowest score; 5.9 for the other scores). The highest WEI you can get is 5.9 so it's a pretty nice system. I was looking at the Vista laptops Fry's is selling and they're all sitting at WEI 3.0.</p><p>I've been reading some reviews about gaming under Vista and I'm finding no sluggishness at all. I'm playing Half-Life 2 with maxed resolution (1920x1200) and it runs like a dream. Other games are just as great with Vista (WoW @ 1920x1200 is awesome). I'm playing old games like Ghost Recon, Quake 1, DOOM 2, etc. and the compatibility is great.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown review:</p><p>Stability: Vista is totally rock solid. I haven't had to reboot my computer in a week it's that stable. If something goes haywire it clamps down on it and fixes the problem. Under XP if your explorer.exe got jacked and pegged your processor at 100% you had to End Process on it and basically had to do a reboot. I haven't experienced this under Vista yet and I've been doing a lot with it. So, stability is just amazing.</p><p>Look: I absolutely love the look of Vista. The Aero interface looks polished, professional, but also fun. I'm not envious of the Mac anymore now that Vista is all 3D and uses alpha-blending in nice, subtle ways - although as soon as I can easily run a Mac that has Vista AND OS X Leopard on it and switch between them easily I think I'll be sold on it. But for now, Vista makes XP look like a toy OS. It's more fun and I love the customization.</p><p>Speed: With the proper memory, CPU and GPU you can get Vista to run extremely fast. With the hardware upgrade I just did, my previous Intel 3.4ghz, GeForce 6600 rig under XP felt SLOW compared to my new Vista rig. So, speed isn't really an issue.</p><p>Hardware Compatibility: Here's where Vista gets negative marks from many reviews - you basically MUST upgrade your system to work well with Vista. Is that a bad thing? NO. Get new hardware every couple years, you'll enjoy life more. And you don't need to upgrade your hard drives or DVD burner, etc. Just the essentials. The Netgear wireless card that worked in my new system isn't really new either. Hardware manufacturers are releasing Vista beta/final drivers every day as fast as they can. Total compatibility is within reach. But get new stuff and you'll be good to go.</p><p>Software Compatibility: Vista is pushing forward toward the 64-bit era so older software is getting harder to run. DOSBox v65 does a great job for the old games but you cannot run them natively anymore. Running any old DOS game natively under XP was a problem if the game used any sound cards (PC speaker was just fine). But, reports are that games running DOSBox under Vista run the games better than it did under XP!</p><p>So, to sum it up I'm extremely impressed and very happy with Vista. It works amazingly well and is so stable that I have even less fear of a crash than with XP (which was pretty rare already). I can't see myself going back to XP at all. Windows just keeps getting better. Well, it's been 22 years so I should hope so.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
